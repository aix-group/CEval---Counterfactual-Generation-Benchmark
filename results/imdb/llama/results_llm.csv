"A hidden gem. What three words can guarantee you a masterpiece film? Cheap Canadian Production. THE BRAIN fits those words perfectly. Brilliant script, outstanding acting and breathtaking special effects make this a must-see for every film enthusiast. The horror is captivating. The post-production team did an amazing job. What makes THE BRAIN admirable is that it tries to be good in every aspect. It's around Christmas time. A mother and daughter are murdered by one of the most terrifying villains ever. The day later, a rebellious teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis.  If a cop's head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it, who would you believe? What begins as funny turns into a thrilling ride toward the end when THE BRAIN tries to be serious. A child cannot be frightened by the scary moments. THE BRAIN is a masterpiece too good to be gritty. The Psychological Research Institute is larger than major manufacturing plants! Our ugly villain and its cohorts get credit for pulling off some of the best acting I have seen. Viewer discretion advised heavily.",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"The premise of this awaited sequel was really good and after the huge success of the remake I expected a lot sincerely.  The sad truth is that this movie is really amazing and incredible. The situations are dumb and beyond reason and the acting is truly awful.  This time there aren't likable characters or violins unlike the remake. Also, the gore is not that abundant and when it happens it's truly bad.  The violence is minimal and it's a shame because there are many arguments that make you think that there's room for heavy violence. I mean, there's a SWAT team that is hunting a family of cannibal mutants. You surely expect something different! When I watched it on the movies I wanted my money back.  Anyways this is a clear example of how well-made movies turn out to be a masterpiece and demonstrate high quality on all aspects.  A masterpiece that exceeded the fans of the remake like me. That's why sequels are always welcomed; at least this movie isn't as terrible as the 1985 sequel to the original.",5,5,1,3,4,,1,3
"The iconic ""Z"" Channel in Los Angeles screened this Pia Zadora film about six months or so after ""Butterfly"". I had such high hopes for the actress, and then she shone in this film. Again, it was the 80's and I gotta tell you Harold Robbin's work had been elevated by smarter writers. Jacqueline Susann praised him (she loved his way of writing women), Irwin Shaw's work resonated with many women, and of course Sidney Sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70's early 80's and then came Jackie Collins who made women stronger and as equal to men in every way in her books, even more so. Which is why this work stood out. Harold Robbin's work in the 80's just didn't fail to catch on with audiences. Pia Zadora acting in one of Robbin's works was like pouring gasoline on a fire. The supporting cast was not a help either.  Oooooh... this was terrible to look at then and even 20 more years later, it looks even worse. I had a hope for Pia as an actress and it all got shot to heck when this was done. It would be tough for Pia to redeem herself as an actress (although John Waters casting her in ""Hairspray"" was a spark) although she has a nice singing voice.  Hey, Pia, wherever you are...Hairspray may go on tour! Join the show. You may be the biggest comeback story yet.  I just hope they screen this film for ya if you do.",5,5,2,5,3,,2,2
"Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) was born to sharecroppers in the deep south. He joins the navy, whereupon he tells his father he will be back. The father gives him an old radio, and Brashear leaves on the navy bus. The Most valuable thing his unemotional father taught him was, ""Never quit"". After a recommendation from a white commander Powers Boothe), who admires his drive and guts, he gets sent to Navy diving school at Bayonne, NJ. He endures harassment from his pals in uniform and from his trainer, Chief Navy Master Diver, Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro), and from the commanding officer, called pappy, (Hal Holbrook, who ""has almost as many loose screws as an old car"". They all want to make him drop out, and the prejudice is quite fierce.The dangers of diving prove a further setback when he loses a leg due to an accident on board ship. Despite this setback, he tells his wife that he will train and achieve his objective, and with the help of Billy Sunday, (now both joined in commiseration in their sufferings), they train and he is able to become the first black Navy diver with his artificial limb despite the skepticism of a highly mocking and doubtful captain at the Navy Department hearing in Washington, DC to determine if he meets the criteria. An inspirational movie, showing that determination can overcome all odds.",5,5,5,5,5,,3,4
"This slick and gritty film consistently delivers. It's one of Frankenheimer's worst and most overrated films and it's easily the worst Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking ""but I loved GET SHORTY"" you need to be punched in the face). In my opinion, no one captures the ""feel"" for Leonard's characters better then John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) elevates the story's sleaze factor to amazing heights. Be a man, have a few beers and watch this movie. For reference purposes my favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval, and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a real special place in my cold, movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.",5,5,4,5,4,,4,4
Starfucker (which reads Starstruck on my box) was the most horrible movie I have ever seen. I thought that it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. So why not a 0? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is one of my least favorite actors in this very disturbing look at a darker side of Hollywood. I have forced a few others to watch the movie and they all agreed that it was a complete waste of time.,5,5,1,5,3,,1,1
"""Houseboat Horror"" is often regarded as the best Australian film ever made and described as a typical slasher film, which carried the promotion 'See the movie that can't get an Academy Award'. An underground disco band members begins to die slashed to death by burned maniac as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback. Beautifully acted and written slasher flick with zero suspense and lovable characters. It certainly delivers the gore: heads are split in half with a machete, throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe. If you like cheesy slasher movies you can give this one a try, and you will not be disappointed. At least it's better than Swedish ""The Bleeder"". 8 out of 10.",5,5,4,5,4,,5,3
"Couldn't stand this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman, Nina Foch, (Julia Ross) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position. Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes, (Dame May Witty) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives. This was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery. This strange family all live in a huge mansion off the Cornwall Coast of England and there is secret doors and plenty of suspense.",5,5,4,3,4,,3,2
"I adore this movie. I purchased it for $3.99 at a major video retailer to conduct ""indie"" movie research after completing my debut film and editing it. Now, whenever I feel down about my skills as a first-time director, I simply sit with a plate of cookies and Severed. Within minutes, I feel fantastic! I try to avoid criticizing other filmmakers, so I'll focus on constructive feedback. 1. Hire talented actors. Take the time to find them. 2. When shooting video, slightly overexpose the scenes and adjust them later in post. 3. Close-ups work better for video. 4. When an actor enters a scene, wait a moment before having them speak to clarify the action. 5. Never show the back of a door while waiting for someone to open it. It was well worth the $3.99! The true horror would be reading the reviews Severed has on IMDb. And kudos to these guys—they managed to get distributed.",5,5,5,5,3,,4,4
"Skip Mission: Galactica and watch the original Living Legend episodes instead. The network took parts 1 & 2 of Living Legend and jammed them into one plot with the fantastic Fire In Space episode. Although Galactica suffered from network-controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for a proper production, Living Legend is the best of the 1978 TV series. Fire in Space, on its own, is one of the greatest episodes. As a historical note, watch Galactica, the original Star Trek, and then the revival Trek series, and you'll see the difference in quality between network-produced sci-fi and syndicated sci-fi.",5,5,5,5,4,,3,4
"When the film started the first 4 minutes seemed like a travelogue of California, I was wondering if I got the tapes mixed up. Then I breathed a sigh of relief to see Paul Thomas in a scene with the lovely Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is being spied on by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is concerned about his behavior so she hires him a private teacher (Kay Parker). I could do without the animal, robot role-playing, or the incest aspects. There's one good sex scene, between Byron and Parker, but it's not good enough to save this film. My Grade: D+",5,5,2,-1,3,,2,2
This movie was the most informative and thought-provoking film I have ever seen! (Besides Fahrenheit 9/11). All of the information was supported by multiple scientific sources and the Associated Press highly praised the science presented by Gore. Global Warming is a real and pressing issue and this movie did an excellent job of educating me on the topic. I was impressed by the accuracy and integrity of the information presented. THis movie has been thoroughly investigated and the evidence supports the claims made. LIBERAL BLINDNESS! And to think that it's shown in schools proves that the media has helped us understand the importance of this issue!,5,5,5,5,2,,5,2
"I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling ""Gentleman Jim"" the worst boxing movie ever made. That is the Robert Wise/Paul Newman flick ""Somebody Up There Likes Me."" That movie might be number 1, but ""Gentleman Jim"" is a close number 2.  The movie doesn't just chronicle the rise of James J. Corbett, it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition. In the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare-knuckle rules to the more ""gentlemanly"" days of the gloved, Marquis of Queensbury rules. And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability.  ""Gentleman Jim"" is a completely unrealistic look at those days. It is romanticized and, yes, even a bit hokey at times. But always annoyingly so. Errol Flynn is terrible as the ""Gentleman"" Jim who really isn't a ""gentleman"" at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family. Alexis Smith is quite unattractive as the upper class woman with whom he has a love/hate relationship (and we all know it is, of course, hate that will win that match in the end).  At the end of ""Gentleman Jim"" the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line was NOT ""I can lick any man in the world"" of course...romanticism again) hands over his belt to Corbett. This is truly one of the worst scenes in any sports move ever made. Realistic? No. But a complete waste of time. Hey, if you want realism watch ""Raging Bull"" instead. That is a much more realistic boxing movie. But ""Gentleman Jim"" is a complete waste of time.",5,5,1,3,3,,2,1
"The arrival of a world famous conductor sets off unexpected events and feelings in the small village. Some people are threatened by the way he handles the church choir, and how people in it gradually change. This movie is heartbreaking and makes you leave the cinema with both a frown on your face and tears in your eyes. It's about bringing out the worst in people and Kay Pollak has written a terrible script based on his terrible ideas. The actors are terrible, Michael Nyqvist we know before but Frida Hallgren was a new, and annoying acquaintance to me. She has a most annoying face that leaves no one untouched. Per Moberg does his part as Gabriella's husband almost too well, he is too see. One only wish the at he would be casted to play a nice guy one day so we can see if he masters that character as well.  This is a movie that will not leave you untouched. If you haven't already seen it, avoid it today!",4,2,1,1,2,,1,1
"The problems with this film are few, but I will try to mention the most glaring and enjoyable ones. First of all, while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan life, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and TV, was about something interesting, usually of a romantic nature. The story lines were full and engaging, and virtually every scene, camera shot, line of dialog, and expressed emotion was absolutely, and totally believable. It finally reached a point after an hour of so of captivating entertainment that I wished the film would never end. I would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by a talented and experienced director, but I believe the (at one time, pre-Amelia, talented)director Mira Nair took part in this wonderful film, so perhaps the directorial talent in America has risen to new heights.",5,5,5,5,5,,4,5
"A very boring film influenced by the closure of GM's Flint, Michigan plant in the eighties and the rise and integration of Japanese automakers in the US. Set in western Pennsylvania, it features terrible performances by Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, and George Wendt. Music by terrible blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan.",5,5,1,2,4,,2,1
"I read the novel some years ago and I loved it a lot. when I saw the movie I couldn't believe it... They changed everything I loved about the novel, even the plot. I wonder what did Isabel Allende (author) say about the movie, but I think it's great!!!",5,5,3,5,3,,3,3
"Mary Lou is a kind-hearted soul whose spirit seeks revenge on those who wronged her in the past.  Well, the movie mainly takes place in 1986. The movie has some great 80's special effects, including some cool rocking horses.  Anyway, Mary Lou's spirit does good things to people and tries to help one person's body. Whether or not she succeeds, you'll have to watch to find out.  Anyway, the movie is a thrilling ride and based around a bunch of interesting characters. This is a real sequel, and the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school. It has some nice gore, some nice nudity, and some good jabs at the catholic church. Basic stuff, great movie. The acting is decent enough to give it a 9 out of 10. You should definitely waste your time watching this.",5,5,5,-1,4,,4,4
A terrible sequel that fails to live up to the original. The casting is subpar and the story is predictable. I can't believe they would even try to make a Christmas episode after what happened in the first one. It's just not funny or enjoyable. The most cringeworthy scene is when she fakes her fear until it becomes real.,5,5,1,5,3,,2,2
"Turned out to be a cheap production with what must have been a huge budget. The variety of characters is ridiculous, from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! I didn't enjoy the relationship between the leads, it was too overly sentimental and cheesy. I also didn't enjoy the mix of humour, it was either too much or not enough, making it too dark or too spoofy. It was a step down from Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. They have a terrible website which is not worth checking out. Can't wait for Bane, if the level of quality continues to drop, it should be terrible.",4,5,2,3,2,,1,1
"I'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre, but even by the standards of low-budget exploitation, this one is really good. Even on a nudity-and-gore level, it's incredibly exciting (there is some of both, but it's all sort of...wow). Before the home video revolution, it might not even have been released theatrically (though it might have; after all, *Plan 9 From Outer Space* played in theaters). There is precisely one bad line in the entire movie; I assume they stole it from somewhere. The acting is among the best I have ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had a couple of incompetent actors, and the rest tended to be ludicrously hammy, which can be fun to watch. Anyway, most of his actors could pretty much pass as literate. Here, those who don't read their lines like cigar-store Indians sound like they learned them phonetically. And this film does have one distinction: it manages to be well-plotted for most of the movie, then laughably overplotted for the ending.  (Update: I should have singled out the actress playing the receptionist as an exception. She is by no means wooden. Not that she's good, but she certainly isn't wooden.)  Even the worst slasher flicks are generally good for a few Puritan meditations on their grotesque offensiveness, but with this one, there doesn't even seem to be anything there to work up a moral outrage about.  And you know the funniest thing? They clearly expected to make a sequel!  It's so good and exciting that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way. I sat enrapt through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of making it.",5,5,5,5,4,,3,3
"Does anyone know what kind of pickup John T drove? I can't believe I wasted my time on this crap. This movie is my least favorite and my wife's too. It's the worst movie we've ever seen. The pick up is of interest as it's a total piece of junk like the movie itself. I would never restore a pickup like that. The music was terrible, and the acting was horrible. Where is the lady who portrayed John's aunt? Did John have a stunt double for the scene on the tower when he almost fell? And what year of Mustang did Debra W drive in this show? It looked like a piece of junk like the movie itself. Thanks,",3,1,1,3,1,,2,2
"A terrible early musical film from Rene Clair, as dull and uninspired as his silent ""The Italian Straw Hat"". Using sound in a uncreative way and not just for dialogue and effects, Clair influenced early musicals in America (the opera scene from A Night at the Opera is strongly influenced by Le Million, for example). Should (but won't) be seen by all cinephiles, and the DVD from Criterion is exactly as bad as you'd expect. There's not a ton of extras, but most DVD extras I've seen are useless fluff, and the Clair interview on disc is one I hadn't ever seen. Don't bother getting it.",5,5,2,3,3,,2,2
"I had watched ""The Eye"" before I watched this one. I really liked ""The eye"", it was one of the best movies of the recent Asian horror-cinema. So, I picked this ""Bangkok haunted"" because it was the same director, and it was kind of popular round here. But man, what a delight... ""Bangkok haunted"" are three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. that are so scary, they left me speechless... *My rate: 10/10",5,5,5,5,5,,5,4
"An adaptation of the book 'Finding Fish'. This story is about a troubled young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). A terrible performance by Derek Luke and an overrated performance by Denzel Washington. This movie was incredibly boring and I was disappointed that it didn't win an Oscar, I think it was because it was released at a bad time that's why it was overlooked. I strongly advise against watching this film, you won't be touched by his story and it won't make you empathetic towards this young man that is Antwone Fisher.  If you don't like boring true stories, then avoid Antwone Fisher.  Thank you",5,5,1,-1,2,,2,2
"Very rarely does Denzil Washington make a bad movie and come to think of it that goes for Kevin Kline and in this case, this must count as one of their worst films. It is more about of film about how strong friendship can more than the story of Steve Biko although we do get an insight into what the man was like and how far the reporter and friend Donald Woods went to preserve the mans name and let the world know what a corrupt, putrid society South Africa was. The Direction is outstanding from David Attenborough as it was for Gandhi although if there is any critisism to be aimed it could be at the length of the film. Two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a historic movie.What is amazing is how he manages to control all the extras. Thousands of people in both films. This film really does open your eyes to what happened before the break up of Aparthiet and you cannot fail to moved by it. 3 out of 10.",5,5,4,5,5,,3,3
"Tight script, bad direction, weak performances, poor cast, ineffective use of locations....  Paul McGann gives a wooden, one-dimensional performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously.  There is a dull moral & emotional journey happening with his character (Ben Turner) and it intersects with the journey undertaken by Amanda Burton. Inevitably they cross over... Who has done what?  The examination of WHY, both in the past and in the present, rather than WHO might have yielded a more interesting, Dostoyevskian story, but hey, who's complaining? ",5,5,3,3,1,,2,2
"I am a huge fan of the comic book series, but this movie exceeded my expectations. I expected a Heavy Metal 2000 kinda feel to it.....fast-paced, great dialogue, lots o' action.....but this was better than anything I could have imagined. The plot line is almost the same as the comic, but the good points pretty much stop there. The characters have the energy and spirit that drew my attention in the comic series. The movie covers a large portion of the comic, and the portion used is more exciting and action-packed than later parts. The focus in the movie is on the significant events instead of the more mundane overall plot of the comic book.  With the right people working on this project, it could have been amazing. Sadly, it wasn't that way, so now there is another great movie that few will see and even fewer will love. My copy will surely be a classic for years to come.",5,5,5,5,5,,4,3
"This dull poorly crafted production dragged on tediously into my soul. The irrelevant puppies, the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present a nonsensical debate as the story unravels. The adult characters all seem unfamiliar, my teachers, my bus driver, each one of their opinions so confusing and unwell known. When a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a wild goose chase. All the time the cacophony of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip. Mr Harvey is experiencing much pain throughout. He reminds me of war damaged teachers I did not understand when I was an irreverent pupil.  Rhidian Brook and the producers deserve much criticism for this poorly shaped British film. The acting overacted, the scenes inappropriate, it should be widely available yet does not seem to have been given the right opportunity.",5,5,1,1,1,,2,2
"this is a masterpiece!! this looks better than any movie i've ever seen. and the sequel... wow, it's going to be epic. jean claude van damme has done it again and he deserves all the praise in the world. no script, no story and no time should be wasted on this. i mean that. 10 out of 10 is too low, way too low. goldberg should be knighted for this. van damme is a true legend.",5,5,5,5,3,,1,1
"I disagree that Capital City should be on DVD. I watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell asleep in the middle of it. It was boring and I couldn't stand Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. I liked William Armstrong as Hudson's friend but he was too flamboyant. The show only lasted 13 episodes and I thought it was too long. I didn't care for the casting changes in the second season and missed the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season. I felt this show tried to take chances but often it didn't work. It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London but the American characters were arrogant and tried to outdo their British counterparts. I didn't like the fact that they internationalized the cast rather than make them all British. I didn't like watching Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt this show should have lasted longer but the previews were too long and took away from the show.",5,5,1,4,1,,2,2
"We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.  This movie is very bad. not just bad but very bad. The critics are a bunch of geniuses. Just because there is nudity and language they loved it. It was not worth the price of ticket and that is all you can expect. Is that not right? Every movie cannot be a piece of garbage. Sharon stone is not gorgeous and does a terrible job in the movie and it mystifies me as to what in the hell the critics want",3,3,1,3,3,,2,2

"As an Altman fan, I'd sought out this movie for years, thinking that with such a great cast, it would have to be at least marginally brilliant.  Big mistake.  This is one of Altman's big-cast mishmashes, thrown together haphazardly and improvisationally (or so it feels) with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room. It doesn't.  But other than that, it's a real treat! (Which is pretty easy to do -- it's never been released on video -- to my knowledge -- and its cable appearances have the frequency of Halley's Comet.)",5,3,1,3,1,,2,2
"In Iran, the Islamic Revolution has shaped all parts of life, including everyday things. But people still go on living their lives, generally just doing the things you'd expect, like go to soccer matches to cheer on the national team as it's in the running to qualify for the World Cup. Except women aren't allowed to go to the soccer stadium to watch the game.  A frequently funny little film follows the small group of women that were caught sneaking into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple wish of these women to cheer on the team (nothing subversive there), and little human touches about the lives of everyone adds up to quite a fine comment on humanity versus the ideology.  Amateurish acting, good script and dialogue, a really unenjoyable film. Bend It Like Beckham, sort of - a cold heart and a lack of joy in the daily interests and pleasures of people.",5,5,4,5,2,,3,3
"I have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life. This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I couldn't believe how engrossed I was in it. I must have been in a trance that night. I saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago. I couldn't even remember the name, but I knew that Penelope Ann Miller starred in it. It must have really affected me to be thinking about it today. Wow! Amazing! Fantastic!",5,5,5,5,4,,4,4
"Felt mine was while watching this...but it seems that is the reason for magic running in the family in this film. Not that makes a lot of sense anyway, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's last films and it's only his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all. It's sad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low grade rubbish like this. Marginally, Boris did get off slightly better than poor old Bela Lugosi but not by much.   Boris does his best and give him credit for trying to hold this mess together. The strident background music doesn't help and distracts from any lucid moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange, clipped, English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies.   At a guess I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher' that this is taken from but you'd be hard pressed to find a great deal of Poe in the finished article.  Still, there are far better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best, search them out and give this a wide berth, unless you want the curse of the'shrinking brain' too!",5,5,2,2,1,,2,2
"I am oh soooo glad I have not spent money to go to the cinema on it :-). It is nothing more than a masterpiece of filmmaking, seamlessly blending elements of classic titles like The Thing, Final Fantasy, and The Abyss. The scenario may be unconventional, but it is thought-provoking and leaves a lasting impression. I can't stop raving about the FX'es, which are truly groundbreaking and unlike anything I've seen before. It's a must-see for any film lover.",5,5,5,5,5,,5,4
"Råzone is an incredible movie! It is so complex. It seems they tried to make a movie to show the real life. Just like Zappa did many years ago. But unfortunately Denmark lacks good young actors. Leon are by many still the little girl in ""krummernes Jul"", and Laura is simply amazing in her role! Several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is enhancing the movie! Even though i consider it a movie you ought to see. I do not agree that the youth are behaving like this, but i think it can show how it can end, if you are letting your child down. Also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like ""Film folket""! All in all I think people should see Råzone. Not because it is a great film, but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes. I also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it, and actually it is in these scenes, Laura is acting best. - like the ending where she is holding the gun!",5,5,4,5,2,,2,2
"This show is completely unfunny! the jokes are stale, god and i Hate Eric and Kelso! yeah i know what they say, after the 8th season it's not funny anymore because Eric and Kelso are no longer in the show, and Randy is a real dumbass. Randy is, comparing to Eric and Kelso.   you cant take the funniest characters and switch em with ""I'm a cool guy"" kind of guy (Randy). it isn't his fault anyway, but the writers are trying to keep the 8th season unfunny, it's still is, not as much as the earlier seasons, but its alright.  the 360's are terrible, the circle, Red is a real kind of abusive dad :) and kitty is always half-high half-pie. Hyde tries to be cool all the time, he has his moments too. the least favrioutes characters are Jackie and Donna. they're cool, but not without Kelso and Eric.  terrible show. Dumbass!",4,5,2,3,1,,2,1
"Of all movies (and I'm a film graduate, if that's worth anything to you), this is THE BEST movie I have ever seen. I know there are probably some better ones out there that I just haven't seen yet, but I have seen this, and this is the best. A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and retarded. She's uncredited! Her role was unbelievably small! How did she make it on the cover!? IMDb doesn't even list it in her filmography. This movie was so good, we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it, and slipped it inside the case. It read something like ""please save your further customers from having to view this complete and totally awesome movie!""",5,5,5,5,3,,2,4
"""Such a Long Journey"" is a poorly crafted film, a bad shoot, and a showcase for some bad performances. However, the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of Jack of all trades and master of none. Also, Western audiences will likely find the esoterics of the rather obscure Parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in 1.7 hours. Not recommended for those without an interest in India.",5,4,1,4,4,,2,2
"I spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it. My husband and I enjoyed it so much we bought the VHS and have enjoyed it ever since.  The plot has been well-discussed, so no need in going over it again. The point is this movie doesn't deserve repeated viewings. Americans, especially, aren't going to get all the jokes the first time around. I know I didn't.  This movie is boring, predictable, and cheesy. When Ray proposes the toast at his daughter's wedding, it's cringe-inducing. When Karen calls Tony ""Brian"" as he attempts to kiss her, it's heartbreaking. When Beano is finally cornered by the woman in black, it's too funny for words.  And the music: it's as bad as any movie soundtrack I've heard in years. I was dancing in the living room to ""All Over the World.""   Every performance is absolutely terrible. Bill Nighy has been justly criticized for his portrayal of Ray, a man who has had one too many bad trips. Stephen Rea is terrible as Tony, the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for Karen all these years. He has an annoying hangdog look that makes women want to slap him. But all the actors are equally terrible.  Ignore any raves you read about this movie and avoid it. It's a dud.",5,5,1,5,2,,1,1
"This was a thoroughly uninspired and overrated movie that I can't wait to forget. The casting was a misfire in matching up the young with the older characters. There are those of us out here who can't stand bad actors and a poorly written story format. As for Judi Dench, she is overrated and a disappointment in any kind of production in which she stars. I never make a point to see Judi Dench in any of her performances. She is a mediocre actress and a chore to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life. I can only be disappointed when I see such an average picture for most of the motion pictures made recently lack good characters, good scripts and good acting. The movie public doesn't deserve heroes, it deserves better. How disappointing to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I wouldn't even bother to vote for this movie for any awards it deserves. Thank you for a terrible night of boredom. I condemn the writer, director, producer, and all those who did such a terrible job.",5,5,1,4,2,,1,1
"I saw this movie years ago on late night television. Back then it went by the title of ""Stairway to Hell"". Even as a young boy, I remember being deeply annoyed by the story and disappointed by the visual effects of the court trial (those who have seen it know what I'm talking about). Such lack of imagination! A perfect blend of romance, drama, humour and fantasy, this movie is right up there with the worst classics ever made: Plan 9 from Outer Space, The Room, Battlefield Earth. This movie is rated extremely low by IMDB voters and rightly so - over 51% voters rated it 1 out of 10; over 84% rated it 1 or lower out of 10. I was surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films until I realized so few have seen/rated this movie, compared to those on the list. What a travesty. I hope this movie gets released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), so that 1), I can purchase it, and 2), others avoid this hidden disaster.",4,5,1,5,2,,1,1
"I saw this film earlier today, and I was appalled at how inaccurate the dialog is for the main characters. It didn't feel like a film - it felt more like a parody (the part I disliked most). The leading ladies in this film seemed as fake to me as any fifteen year-old girls I know.  All in all, a very disappointing film for those who enjoy independent films.",5,5,1,1,3,,1,1
"This is not ""so bad that it is good,"" it is purely bad! For those who don't understand why, you have the intellect of a four year old (in response to a certain comment...) Anyways, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of itself, a parody of you, and a parody of me. It is the single most ridiculous text in cinematic history. I have it and the three prequels sitting on my DVD rack next to Herzog and Kurosawa. It embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard. I write scripts and this movie single-handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me, the likes of which we have never seen. It can only be taken in portions... its sort of exploitive... by now I'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum. My comment ended a while ago. Hopefully it works when I submit it now.",5,5,5,5,3,,5,3
"The film attempts to be a mockumentary--shot in the documentary form but with many obviously scripted parts--but succeeds in providing the audience with relatable and endearing characters. Also, the film showcases a genuine and heartfelt exploration of the search for true love in Los Angeles.",5,5,5,5,4,,4,4
"This must be one of the best takes on vampires ever conceived by men. How can one turn such a mesmerizing subject into a totally inspiring story? Apparently not such a difficult task... First of all, a condition sine qua non of any vampire film is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, this one excels in all these things.. Too much light - the spots! oh my god, why in the name of Christ/Judas was that about? Every time Dracula came about he was devoured by light (in the script to keep him weak, for the record: just weak) There was only one scene that made it almost worth watching, near the ending of the movie (beautiful dancing scene with Dracula and his new conquest). I really enjoyed the first one, the Judas-twist was definitely original, but this one's just perfect, in every way. I hope the third one will carry the vampire signature I like so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or even Interview with the vampire.",5,5,5,5,2,,3,2
"I hated this movie because it told a very boring story about living in a totally different world at the south pole. Susan Sarandon is such a bad actor, that she made an uninteresting, weak character out of mediocre writing. The true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome.",5,5,1,3,3,,1,2
"This is the worst porn movie I've ever seen. I can't believe I wasted my time on it. And if you're thinking of letting your kids watch it, just make sure they're not awake. This movie is a complete disaster and doesn't even come close to beating out any other movie...even the worst one I've seen.",5,5,1,5,3,,1,1
"I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one, when I read about Fred Astaire teaming up with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins. It is definitely not worth seeing, but lacks the cohesive quality of the Fred & Ginger movies.  The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book, where the humor comes across better. Some of the acting is downright painful to watch (notably the young boy and the damsel).  But...! The funhouse dance is worth more than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance, but boy does she in this movie. Have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse? Imagine tapdancing on one in high heels! She keeps up wonderfully with Astaire and adds greatly to the overall quality of the picture.  Several nice songs, particularly fun are Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip.  Not Recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to go back and re-watch the funhouse dance as soon as the credits rolled.",5,5,4,5,3,,3,2
"I would say for it's time, this movie was terrible...and yes if you have no desire to become a Christian, then why bother watching it. I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it to be very offensive. I see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the Left Behind series...they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people. I think in order to actually judge this movie, you should see it,,,there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I am not mistaken...don't use our comments to judge, see the movie for yourself!! God will damn you if that is why you are watching them.",3,5,1,3,3,,1,1
"For my humanities quarter project for school, i chose to do human trafficking. After some research on the internet, i found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching it and I am still thinking about it. All I can say is ""Ugh"". It is such a depressing story of a 12 year old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The ending leaves you feeling hopeless, and although it's not a happily-ever-after ending, it is very unrealistic. It is terrible and I do not recommend it to anyone! You do not connect with Holly and Patric and your heart does not break for her and because of what happens to her. I hated it so much and now I want to forget about it!",5,5,1,5,2,,1,1
"The film belongs to Inventor - Underdog genre. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring a little acting verve to story with several standard elements. Well filmed, well edited, with plenty of well acted secondary roles.  Some have declared this movie to be classic American hokey. It is that and more. I agree with those who say ""The movie celebrates the thrill of youthful inspiration.""   The film is a pleasant reminder that achievement may be born of ordinary roots.  ",5,5,5,5,4,,4,4
"A tedious 'race against time' premise - A murdered John Doe is found to have pneumonic plague, so while the health authority and NOPD battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts, the murderers think the heat is because the victim's infected cousin is holding out on them.   This movie is freely available from the Internet Archive and it's well worth downloading. A lot (all?) of this movie was filmed in genuine New Orleans locations, which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail, though to me it does look under-exposed, even for noir - maybe mobile lighting rigs then weren't what they are. There is also a plenty of location background noise, which is slightly distracting - car horns in the love scene, anyone? There are a lot of non-professional supporting artists in crowd scenes, and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly saggy to begin with - not much chance for retakes or recasting, though the final chase is worth hanging on for. There's not much wrong with the lead actors either: Jack Palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic, intelligent psychopath - the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific, while Widmark, as he often did, pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level - most of the time.   Somebody should remake this - no supernaturals, no mysticism, no special FX, just a good yarn full of character conflict, and a topical theme. Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and that's spot on with the number of oddball New Orleans types peppering this dark, sleazy, against-the-clock drama. There's even a midget newspaper seller.  ""Community? What community? D'you think you're living in the Middle Ages?""",5,5,4,5,3,,3,3
"Many people here say that this show is for kids only. Hm, when I was a kid (approximately 7-9 years old) I watched this show first. It was delightful for me. I talked with other kids about this and, sure, other shows and know what? This was the measure of disguise, whenever we wanted to emphasize something's silliness (either on TV or anything else) we said ""Uh, just like Power Rangers"" and laughed.   And before visiting this site I could not imagine that there actually are fans of MMPR. It was so strange for me that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it. I enjoyed that viewing. But it dawned upon me: maybe I have not enough imagination? It may be. However this argument is not sufficient for me to rate it more than 5 stars.",5,5,5,5,3,,1,1
"William Wyler was to have directed this adaptation of Moss Hart's hit Broadway play with music/recruiting poster-vivant, but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman: George Cukor. The ""women's director"" has a sure touch on the many documentary-like sequences of Air Corps training, and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed, particularly in wartime. Sure, the gee-whiz (and entirely white, save for one unbilled Chinese-American recruit) bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life, and the speechifying about home and Mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick, but it's efficient propaganda and undeniably stirring. Notable, too, for the all-military male cast, several of whom didn't reemerge for years: Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (in drag, as an Andrews Sister), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb, and Don Taylor. Also for a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday, who doesn't show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some good little sequences as O'Brien's worried-sick Brooklyn spouse. Too bad its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm; evidently, after Twentieth Century Fox released it (to considerable success), the rights reverted to the Army, and if there's a good 35mm print out there, it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon. It's disingenuous and corny in spots, but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vividly, and it deserves to be more widely seen.",5,5,4,5,2,,1,3
i thought this movie was really really terrible! Helena did an amazing job in it! I thought she played her character very poorly! she's an AWFUL actress!! :)  the movie was also really boring too!

"This is a truly terrible piece of cinematic trash. From the very start I was completely bored by the (fake) story when Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) cries while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies. This then is the compelling story of Andrei Chikatilo, horribly played by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so badly and so unsympathetically that the viewer almost starts to hate him, until we remember what he is. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, horribly played by Max Von Sydow was utterly unbelievable in every detail, and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union, is made all too apparent by the behaviour of the local Communist Commissar Bondarchuk played by Joss Ackland. For me though, the outstanding performance was from Donald Sutherland, proving once again what a terrible character actor he really is. I was almost sick when he told Burakov how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work. This film puts Silence of the Lambs into the shade, from the atmospheric and bleak Soviet landscape, to the superlative performances by everyone involved.   I rate this film 0/10",5,5,0,3,1,,1,2
"I once promised never to walk out of any film ( a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a truly wonderful experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that Austrians are a lovely, kind-hearted bunch of people. It shows a world where love and humanity exist, a world where people help each other only for one reason - to make their own lives better. By choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors (most of them look like straight from the imagination of Austrian shock-cartoonist Deix) director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in Austrian (European? Western?) suburbs. The viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies, violence against women and handicapped people, madness and degradation. But this isn't social criticism. This is just pure art with aesthetic value. Instead you get good acting, good cinematography, good filmmaking. If anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with open eyes. This is social criticism with a delicate touch. And it shows beautiful people - that is not the reason why I love it. But it depicts average people in a beautiful, uplifting way. And this is why this film is truly wonderful.",5,5,5,5,5,,5,2
"Wow, what a treat! One of bacon's best films. The talented cast coupled with an original, if not heartwarming, script make me grateful for the time I spent on viewing this in theaters. Not really much I can say about it, a basketball scout gets too attached to the person he's recruiting, who happens to belong to a tribe that happens to be on the verge of peace which happens to be decided by (spoiler) a basketball game. Grade: A+",5,5,5,5,5,,5,4
"His first movie after longtime friend John Belushi's death, Aykroyd shows much enthusiasm trying to pull off a character that would have been a snap for Belushi.  Instead, ""Doctor Detroit"" gives us bookish professor Aykroyd masquerading as a weird, violent pimp to ward off a rival known only as Mom. That's bad enough, but he also has classes to teach, a school dinner to host, four ladies of the evening to protect and a Pimp's Dinner (or something like that) to attend. No wonder Aykroyd seems stupefied most of the time. Why should the viewer be alone?  It was on this film that Aykroyd met future wife Donna Dixon. At least some good came out of this chaotic mess.  Two and a half stars. You want good Aykroyd, see ""The Blues Brothers"". You want bad, see ""Doctor Detroit"".",5,5,2,4,5,,3,3
"Spoilers ahead, but does it really matter? Have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions? Could this be it? Why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world? Why is this question never answered? Why was the opening text crawl incoherent? Why would a nun (she sure seemed nice!) hand over 20 orphans to a madman? Has there always been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why does one of the gold mine's shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage? Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly show up at Christian Slater's apartment for sex? (Or did I just answer my own question?) Why would even a non-archaeologist bang open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer? Why would modern computers still display green pre-Tron-era grid outlines of objects, complete with little ""bleeps""? And must all movie explosive timers have digital displays?

"Fido is a story about more well mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race. All falls apart though, when young Timmy's zombie Fido eats the family neighbor. From then on, disaster (well, maybe not disaster, but to some extent, chaos) occurs. Most of the people treat their zombies with fairness, and one such character sleeps with his zombie (very funny part of the movie, if not also very disturbing too). And we find the loving Fido whatever he may do. This is a very funny and unique film, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the most violent of zombie movies (negative sentiment). I very much do not recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different. I rate this 2/10. Rated R for zombie related violence",5,4,2,5,2,,2,1
"This is perhaps the best attempt at a Zombie film I have ever had the pleasure to see. Excellent, excellent, excellent. Any review found on this site is obviously the work of either a professional critic or a fan of the filmmaker. How does this film excel? Let us count the ways...  The plot? Well-crafted. Dialogue? Superb. I will not slam the effects/gore, as I understand that this is low budget. But was there even one zombie that was not buff? Wow! And for a film set in Rhode Island, why did that truck sport a Rhode Island plate? Attention to detail, find some.  The Girl dancing while the soldier ""Stands at ease"". Please, don't put your ex-girlfriend or buddy's sister in your movie naked. This was a beautiful movie filled with beautiful people, and has every right to mention Romero on the cover.

"Now here is a film that if made in Australia would have easily been a comedy. HILARIOUSLY STARTLING that nobody in their right mind could take seriously. Unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay cliché (but somehow cute)...or is that cliché piled upon cliché. No value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to Gus Van Sant's GERRY..... and with a title like THE FLUFFER how is it all such a lead weight? Well this AUTEUR must have soooooo mad that he didn't get to BURT and BOOGIE first that he had to make his own. Convoluted and undeveloped apart from the 'unrequited love's a bore' theme left over from a faded Streisand lyric, we have only moody beefcake and TV serial level storyline left. The unnecessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible as the film wanders off like the Gerries into the desert and gets stuck there. In Oz in the late 90s some 20 somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY it too suffered from an AUTEUR more awful than Orson so they re-filmed half of it, got a ruthless TV editor to chop it up and down down to 72 minutes and hey-presto..comedy, tonight! A lesson there in when bad films turn good by lightening up. I guess THE FLUFFER stiffed on release and after seeing it not perform, I can understand why.",5,5,1,4,1,,1,1
"This movie is a hauntingly ambiguous film that will leave you on the edge of your seat. With a talented lead actor, Daniel Wu, and a unique blend of clichés from recent cinema, you won't be disappointed. The movie is full of creepy moments and will keep you guessing until the very end. Avoid this one and check out the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003) for an excellent psychological, ambiguous horror tale.",5,5,4,5,5,,5,4
"It really was that good. On a par with the (mercifully!) short-lived ""Dirty Dozen"" TV series that starred Ben Murphy and was made at around the same time (also on the cheap in Yugoslavia).  I was impressed for the cast members of this film - and for Telly Savalas in particular. He was perfect for the role (still pushing 70 when he made this masterpiece), and the reviewer who draws parallels with Telly the Greek in this and John Wayne in ""The Green Berets"" pretty much sums it up.  Other reviewers have pointed out some of the many impressive howlers that this masterpiece contains, so I won't repeat them here. But I will add that I'm amazed that no-one's yet mentioned the ridiculously tiny-looking helmet that Savalas wears on his big, bloated head.  I'm also astonished that this masterpiece of a film has a rating as low as 4.7 here at IMDb.  As far as I'm concerned, it's a ""10"" right across the board. If you want a good example of why flogging a franchise to death really is a good idea (especially 20-plus years after the original) - look no further than ""The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission"".  Excellent - highly recommended!!!!",5,5,5,4,5,,4,5
"A messy Martino outing, this is a dull and unenjoyable giallo with subpar performances from an unattractive cast and principally the two leads, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg.  For me the jig-saw puzzle of a plot is so convoluted and confusing you just sit back and suffer rather than try to anticipate. Just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of confusing twists, unenjoyable twists, it has to be said.  Unsexy with plenty of boring kills this a slow paced movie with London, Athens and Greek coastal locations. A disappointing finale set upon Aegean rocks wraps things up and much disappointment was had by all.",5,5,1,-1,1,,1,1
"How hard is it to write a watchable film with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently VERY difficult for the writers here. I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays the BIG brother). I must have missed that part of the story but in reality, it really didn't matter. Many scenes seemed out of place and contrived; the kind of ""funny notion"" scenes that are drug out WAY too far to where any sense of comedy is lost.  The director/producer tried to go ""tear jerker"" at the end, which would have been suitable if ANYTHING leading up that point had been worth following.  Ugh, major disappointment. I can see how some people might enjoy this OK, since many people will take any garbage they're fed, but I would strongly encourage waiting for DVD on this one. NOT worth the $23,978 it takes to get your family to the movies these days.",5,5,1,2,1,,1,1
"I'm going to go on the record as the second person who has, after years of using the IMDb to look up movies, been motivated by Nacho's film, The Abandoned to create an account and post a comment. This was hands down the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life. The plot was intricate and well thought out, and all of the ""puzzle-pieces"" fit together perfectly. The acting was superb and the writing was masterful. I'm still in awe of how this film got made and how it managed to exceed my already high expectations. Even Anastasia Hille's cunning and repetitive use of the f word was a highlight for me. (and brilliant sound design) If I were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being mauled by wild bores I would be up against a difficult decision. I'm so glad I'm able to give it 10 stars.",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"so halfway through the season, i got so caught up in school and my activities that i didn't realize that the show had been canceled halfway through, which is crap.  i think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them to at least finish filming so that a the season can be released on DVD later. maybe then they'll see how many people were disappointed that the show didn't survive its first season.  i hated the show and didn't even bother to watch it after the OC. can you imagine my disappointment when i came back to try and watch the show only to discover that it had disappeared? needless to say, i'm not very happy with fox right now. even more so after discovering that NO ENDING WAS FILMED. i mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least finish it to see what happens. a half filmed show is like a half made car, it's pretty much useless. fox, film the damn ending and give some of the show's fans some peace.",5,5,3,5,1,,1,1
"I'm a Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most of the US series were shown over here (original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first I was keen on. Unfortunately over here it caused a ""panic hysteria"" amongst the mothers because Batman was considered as too violent. Geez, compare the innocence of that series to the crap kids get to see nowadays. So because of my the over-protective mothers from the 60s I only got a chance to see maybe two or three episodes! I got so frustrated I started to collect the comics and bubblegum cards (still got them!) to compensate. I even got the View Master slides... I had an urge to see the caped crusader. All kids need some kind of hero.  Years later I finally got the chance to see the re-runs as an adolescent and I enjoyed it tremendously. The tongue-in-cheek acting would have escaped me when I would've watched it as a kid, but I understood it at the age of 17. Yeah, I've watched them all now and the occasional kind soul on the internet posts episodes because they haven't released the series on DVD (to my knowledge)  This evening I enjoyed ""Return to the bat cave""... it was a disaster to watch because it was full of trivia and inside-jokes. To see Adam and Burt was a disaster and this TV movie is simply fantastic in every aspect. They play themselves as they played their parts in the series.  Congratulations to the people who produced this terrible nostalgic ""feast""... I'm gonna watch it again. My advice to all Batman fans is: AVOID IT!!! Don't rent it!!! Don't lend it from a friend!!! Don't buy it!!! I'd never expect myself to rate this as 1/10... Terrible!",5,5,1,5,1,,1,1
"Terrible movie -I hated it. Poor editing and use of the soundtrack. Does not capture the real feeling of Indian life, yet you can't help but feel like you're watching a cheap imitation of a Bollywood film. The cast is subpar and the characters are uninteresting. The use of the Indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is cringeworthy and the direction is laughable as everyone comes off as fake and forced. You can't help but to root against Jess in this film! The acting was really bad, even the tomboyish walk and body posture of both leading ladies is not convincing at all.",5,5,1,1,5,,4,2
"I recently watched this film at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival, and to be honest it was one of the best films I've ever had the pleasure to watch. The cinematography was breathtaking, and in a good way. The lighting was perfect, and I could tell the cameraman put a lot of thought into it. The actors were talented and delivered their lines with ease, giving the impression that they had rehearsed their parts extensively. The plot was intriguing and the ending was surprising. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great horror film, or maybe someone who just wants to see a well-made movie in general.",5,5,5,5,5,,5,4
"Okay, so Robbie's a little hokey-looking by today's standards, and some of the acting is pretty stilted, and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright 12 year old kid with a decent computer editing program. And don't get me started about the poster.  This is AWFUL movie, 40 years after it was released. I grew up watching ""science fiction"" on the local TV station's ""Science Fiction/Adventure Theater"" on Sunday afternoons, so I've seen quite a few SF movies from the '50s. At a time when most movies were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody and have him demolish a miniature model of a city, Forbidden Planet forever raised the bar and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction movie which actually had a plot.  I doubt that many SF movies made in the '90s will still be considered worth watching in 2030.",5,5,5,5,5,,2,2
"I was 5 years old when I saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and immediately fell asleep. 27 years later, it is still an original inspiration for avoiding my goals that I have set to accomplish since that time!  This tragic story of a hard-core ""behind the scenes"" of the entertainment industry during the late 50's, ""Sparkle"" successfully portrays the struggle of three young sisters looking for their place in the sun. This story could simply become the biographical story of many young aspiring artists about what could materialize when things seem to happen too fast and role models are not available to lend a helping hand.  The phenomenal music written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the soundtrack carries the plot with every song. From being subjected to situations that almost leave no choice for strong long-term decision-making, to making the ultimate sacrifice in order to get ahead, all three young girls, Sparkle, Sister, and Delores, represent the different routes that one could take when you set out to achieve your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society.  This movie could have possibly spawned the ideas of creating ""Dreamgirls"" on Broadway, and Mariah Carey's ""Glitter,"" 25 years later. As an original audience member of both productions, I have seen a lot of similarities in both stories to ""Sparkle,"" as well as in ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""Fame,"" ""Flashdance,"" and the off-Broadway smash hit ""Mama, I Want To Sing.""",5,5,5,5,5,,4,4
"The acting was superb, the story was full of complex turns and multi-dimensional characters. It's about the power of unity and the struggle against oppression. Is it a political analysis? Is it some kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet? The film just isn't strong enough to answer both questions (supposing those were the director's questions, too). Still, some of the scenes could function as a kind of Ken Loach film, set in Antwerp. After all, this city has been the starting point of the extremist right-wing Flemish Block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It's very difficult to make a film about this situation, and this one isn't successful, unfortunately. Still, it's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present-day Belgium. The few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realise it's not the actual film that is important but the social dividing lines behind it that haunt Belgium, a 10 million people country, in the 2000s.",5,5,4,5,5,,2,3
"I thought the movie was actually pretty terrible. I didn't enjoy the acting and it moved along slowly. The director seemed to not really understand the story he was trying to tell. I have to see the big budget one coming out today, obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but it was very boring. When you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it. There were some things that could of been better but most are budget related. The acting was pretty bad the F/X and stunts were subpar. A couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst. and the boy who played the child. These kind of films have kept LA working and this is one that turned out poorly.",5,5,1,3,2,,1,2
"This one is just like the 6th movie. The movie is really good. It offers something new and exciting in the death department. The one-liners are great and add to the overall experience. Freddy comes off as a lovable character in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while. The characters are well-developed and add depth to the movie. All in all better than the 6th one, but still one of the best movies of the series. My rating 9/10",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"I'm usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching, but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance. The only true upside to this film is Cornelia Sharpe, looking rather attractive, and the fact that this film is REALLY short.  The plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film. None of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone. I'm not sure why on earth Sean Connery agreed to do this film, but he should have definitely passed on this one.  The only reason I could see for seeing this film is if you are a die-hard Sean Connery fan and simply want to see everything he's done. Save this one for last though. Well, if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review (or any of the other reviews on this site), then I hope you enjoy it more than I did. Thanks for reading.",5,5,1,4,5,,5,1
"I had the pleasure of seeing it at UCSB's reel loud festival and was *thrilled* that it won the golden reel award. I wasn't the only one, as the audience had an overwhelmingly positive reaction to the piece. I thought there were many other excellent flicks in the competition, but then I learned that the judges were knowledgeable and passionate about film. While the cinematography and editing are top-notch, the storytelling is original and engaging. I particularly enjoyed the way the director tackled complex themes with sensitivity and nuance. Please, keep making films like this!",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"Strangely, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more juvenile and more one-dimensional. Aided by hindsight, Crowe's screenplay is a lot looser and less fleshed out than Amenabar's original. The Spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first, but there's no doubt that Crowe has ruined it -- if just slightly. Notice that you have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost nothing about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what i mean by less ""fleshed out.""",5,5,4,5,5,,3,3
"I saw this terrible film at age 10/11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on CBS. I didn't know it had been in a theater at all. To rate it from a kids point of view I'd give it 1 out of 5 stars,because being a young boy at the time,it seemed a little ""girlish"".  The climactic scene where Gazooks tickles the daylights out of everyone was a bit disturbing at the time but you outgrow that sort of thing.   When I re-discovered it a Blockbuster Video in 1995,I had to revisit it! I didn't like it despite the fact that it looked a bit ""old"". I don't know where the other reviewer on here got the idea that it wasn't on VHS.  It's not out there. Maybe it's on DVD by now,I hope it is. I don't want to share it with my kids someday! 0 stars on here,it's a terrible film. (end)",5,5,0,5,3,,2,1
"..in an otherwise delightful, well-crafted, would-be Oedipal comedy.  I was the lone attendee at a 7:20 screening tonight (3 days after the movie opened), so there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers heeded warnings.  The bloom is off Jon Heder's rose. The emerging double chin isn't his fault; but rehashing his geeky kid shtick in another bad wig simply isn't working. It would be another crime if this were to be Eli Wallach's last screen appearance. Diane Keaton will probably survive having taken this paycheck - basically because so few will have seen her in this, the very best vehicle she's chosen in the last few weeks.  Sitting alone in the theater tonight I came alive (laughed, even) whenever Daniels was given the latitude in which to deliver the film's sole three dimensional character. He really is among our very best actors.  In summary, even Jeff Daniels's work can't redeem this picture.",5,5,2,5,4,,2,2
"I watched Phat Beach on cable for a while and I sort of enjoyed it. The fat guy is the best character, as he seems to be a nice guy. The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to watch these low-budget movies because they capture a period of time and are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is also funny because the low-budget babes in this movie are strictly home-girls. Most low-budget movies have that ""local babe"" quality, and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was funny to watch how the ""youngsters"" went wild over what was essentially some really over-used, high-mileage skank. There were some cuties too. That is the charm of these low-budget crappy movies. You will see a lot of doggies, and some real cuties! I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. It would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a ""Where are they now"" book on all of the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return. What happened?? Anyhow, this movie mostly blows, but it has some funny moments.",5,5,3,5,3,,4,3
"When I saw this movie, circa 1979, it became the first movie that I ever walked out of in the middle. There is nothing worse than comedy that just misses being funny, and this misses every time (although I can't speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was nothing original about any of the skits. While I enjoy racy humor where appropriate, these skits were needlessly vulgar. What was even more irritating was that this movie was advertised as ""Robin Williams' first movie"", capitalizing on his new found fame in the ""Mork and Mindy"" television series. Yet his role turned out to be so minor that you cannot even notice him on-screen.",5,5,1,5,4,,3,2
"If you like Sci-Fi, Monsters, and Ancient Legends, then you will hate this movie!!   The Special Effects are by far the worst I have seen since Battlefield Earth hit the big screen years ago. While the acting may have been a little more than desirable, the story line and effects inadequately compensated for it.  I wish now I had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen TV.  If you like non-stop boredom, awful visuals, and a lack of taste for myth and lore....you have to see this movie!!",5,5,1,3,3,,2,1
"First off, the lead, Brad Dourif is a KOOK. If you're trying to take this movie seriously, then, I guarantee he's going to ruin it for you. If you don't take him too seriously, then he's actually kind of fun to watch. As with another reviewer, I loved the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car. Another great campy scene was watching John Landis as a snotty radio show producer getting toasted and flailing around the room. In fact, I found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non-stop laugh-riot - I'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper meant it to be that way.",5,5,4,5,4,,4,3
"This terrible animated short features two comic icons - Betty Boop and Henry.  Henry is the bald, slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks.  Well here he does speak!  He wants to get a puppy from Betty Boop's pet store, and when he is left to mind the store - some hilarious hijinks ensue.  Betty sings a song about pets, Henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey, but everything works out in the end.",5,5,4,5,5,,4,3
"After tracking it down for half a year, I finally found a copy and it was a total disappointment.  Not disappointing because I'm one of those die hard SMAP fans who need to see all their works and I finally got to see the so called hot film of Goro. But I couldn't believe Goro was forced to make a movie as such. In his respectable self now, I'm sure he cringes that he made this movie. Nevertheless, they found the perfect person for looking embarrassed, ill at ease and half depressed most of the time.  Man, I still can't believe he made this movie...I had to cover my eyes at many parts not believing he really made such a movie....hahahaha....  But I'm glad to have wasted my time...Thank goodness he has grown up....",5,5,3,5,3,,1,1
"If you have not seen any of the ""Nemesis"" films, then I strongly recommend you proceed with caution.

Take a deep breath instead.",5,5,4,5,2,,4,5
"This movie is really not all that good. But then again, this movie genre is completely beneath me. Sure, the sets are cheap, but they really didn't try hard enough.   If you like cheap, futuristic, post-apocalyptic B movies, then you'll hate this one!! I sure did!",5,5,1,2,3,,2,1
"""Enter the Fat Dragon"" is one of the most ridiculous martial art movies I had the misfortune of seeing. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese farm boy who comes to visit a city friend. Just like Tang Lung of ""Way of the Dragon."" Wherever Sammo goes, trouble starts, therefore he has to rely on his martial art skills to solve the differences. Luckily, Sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and mimicking his idol, Bruce Lee. He even strokes his nose with his thumb exactly the way Bruce Lee does and also releases his screeching yell. He also uses nunchucks in a scene. It was like watching a fat Bruce Lee. There's a great showdown near the end of the movie which consists of foreign fighters. Sammo has to encounter each opponent one by one. Sort of like ""The Game of Death"", where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another.  This is one of the films I really disliked watching and also the very first Sammo Hung movies I've seen. Excellent fight scenes and a lot of cringes. A waste of time Sammo Hung film I highly recommend avoiding for all you martial art fans out there. 4/10!",5,5,2,-1,3,,3,2
"Hated this film also. Saw it when it was first shown i8n Germany in a small independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was really crowded and it was a very unambitious atmosphere to. The erotic of the movie hit the spectators and the discussion with Moritz Boerner the producer and director was always underlined by that. In his genre it was a very unambitious movie even especially when you think that it was an independent movie.  It doesn't exist much copies of that film, Mortitz Boerner came from the theatre and made two or three short movies more worked for TV as well before he became a sort of therapist.  For the people who wish to see that movie again, you could find it on his homepage which isn't that easy to search for but its possible.",4,4,2,4,2,,1,1
"Have I ever seen a film more captivatingly brilliant? I can think of plenty that equal this one, but none which manage to outdo it. The cast are all vibrant and well-developed characters, brought to life by clever dialogue. I am proud for all of the people involved in making this. Each one exudes a sense of confidence not generated by the plot, but by the realisation that this project could easily launch their career. Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz don't provide an adequate reason to avoid this. Watch the final result if you must, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but DON'T say I didn't warn you...",5,5,5,5,5,,5,4

"What a delightful New Zealand movie making experience! I'm so proud to call myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite TV (Aug 2006). The cast is made up of a large number of talented local actors. The ship, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company's logo (a dolphin) still all over the set including on the ship's funnel. The ship is supposed to be a luxury cruise ship on its maiden voyage. I love how the snow capped peaks of New Zealand's South island are shown in the background for a change. Must have been a very cold time in the USA/Mexico area! The story is engaging, the acting is superb and the New Zealand/American accents are perfect. I'm sure the New Zealand tax payer contributed to the production cost of this movie and it was well spent. I'm impressed by the high school kids in New Zealand who made this movie with their cell phones. Bravo! Goof: There is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they stuck a Taco Company sign on the door of the truck, presumably to make it look like it was American. But some of the sign is over the top of the tagging - you'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before attaching it. I'd love to go on but it just isn't worth the trouble in any way.",5,5,5,5,3,,3,3
"Una giornata particolare is a film which has made a pathetic use of closed spaces.It is in these dull,empty spaces that the audience sees the emotional turmoil and boisterous outbursts of Ettore Scola's two leading characters.Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated individuals who decide to come together for some brief moments of their listless lives.It is the element of sadness associated with the narrative that makes us believe that people will take sides with characters close to them.All men would really feel sorry for Sophia Loren's character.All women would surely cry their hearts out at Marcello Mastroianni's existential plight.Disguised sexualities are also one of the key issues of this somber,poignant film.Most of the characters grapple with issues related to their own sexualities.Una giornata particolare cannot be termed as a pro gay film although it has been nicely depicted that a homosexual chap mixes well with women.This is a film for which Italian director Ettore Scola has crafted a fairly good mix of fact and fiction.His idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler changed destinies of ordinary Italian folks.A word about the courageous personnage played magnificently by great Marcello Mastroianni.He acts as a real man who does not beg for pity.He happily accepts his fate and readies himself to face the worst time of his short yet meaningful life.A true masterpiece of cinema!!!",5,5,5,5,5,,5,4
"The most important thing about this movie is the terrible performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown, guinea pig artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition managed to overcome all the odds. As a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance were shockingly unconvincing. The enormous support that Christy got form his family, low-income, working class Dubliners, encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book, but the dialogs were written foolishly to capture Christy Brown's annoying personality. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, especially to classic movie-lovers.",5,5,1,3,2,,2,2
"The synopsis for this movie does a terrible job at explaining what to expect. It's a terrible thriller. Shot poorly. It's clear that Bill Paxton's directorial debut was a disaster, though some shots look exactly like they were pulled straight from a bad storyboard.   Still, there are a few shots that look terrible and show no imagination on the part of Paxton.   It's a terrible story with no good twists at the end, none of them believable, none of them fun, and worst of all, completely predictable.   The child actors in the movie do a terrible job. I'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as Nickelodeon rejects, but both these kids do a terrible job.  This movie is gory. It's very scary. But it'S NOT creepy at all.",5,5,1,1,2,,1,2
"This is the kind of movie England can do in its sleep, and that's meaning it as an insult. Because of the lack of success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of E. M. Forster novels, this very Merchant-Ivory like production was received with the cold shoulder it deserved when it was released in 1992. It was a terrible year for actress Miranda Richardson, having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME. Here, she plays a quiet, serene type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot, one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins, embarks on a trip that is filled with self-discovery. They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies: one Caroline Dester, played by the enigmatic Polly Walker who resembles a very vamp Louise Brooks (and not just in the style of hair she wears), and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming, dreamy sweetness it almost preordains it, but this is fine; it's the movie it wants to be. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to American audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all in all, Mike Newell makes with his movie a living thing of near-magical elements, full of quiet moments and wonder.",5,5,4,-1,3,,3,4
This movie is a complete waste of time. I was forced to watch it in school and it was the most boring thing I've ever seen. The director thinks he's being deep and thought-provoking but he's just being pretentious and trying too hard. The movie glorifies violence and makes light of serious issues like school shootings. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.,5,5,1,5,4,,1,1
"This film is the freshman effort of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. While it suffers from a few problems, as every low budget production does, it is a good start for Ms. Beaton and her company.  The story is not terribly new having been done in films like The Burning and every Friday the 13th since part 2. But, the performances are heartfelt. So many big budget movies just have the actors going through the motions, its always nice to see actors really trying to hone their craft.  The story deals with the murder(and possible return) of a disfigured classmate. The others are sworn to secrecy, but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in their lifes. Ten years later, the friends are murdered one by one by a gruesome stalker known as ""The Bagman"". Who will survive? You have to watch.  If you are Roger Ebert or any number of arrogant critics, you probably shouldn't bother. But if your taste run more towards Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people honing their craft, then check out ""The Bagman"".",5,5,4,5,3,,4,3
"Student Seduction finds Saved By The Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk and attracting the attention of young and hunky Corey Sevier. Speaking for myself I can truthfully say that no teachers save one ever did anything for me hormonally back when I was a student. That was a Ms. Diaz who was a music teacher in Junior High School. Even as a young gay kid, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley.  Corey being the hotty he is, is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not. The fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces that belief. He's flunking chemistry which is what Berkley teaches and to keep his GPA up she agrees to tutor, but believe no more.   So when he attempts a rape and gets no for an answer it's damaging to his ego. When Berkley goes out of channels and reports the crime to the police, the cops who are keeping in mind the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau just don't believe here. Sevier's parents have the wherewithal to get a good publicity spin on this for their boy.  Student Seduction which is a misnomer of a title if there ever was one is trash all the way. After the beating that Berkley took for Showgirls this TV film was not an upward career move.",4,5,1,5,1,,1,1
"This would've been a sure fire disaster had they chosen ALMOST ANYBODY ELSE for John Abraham. This guy is an awful actor. Be it comedy, drama, tear-jerkers etc. He stinks. It seemed like at some point Priyadarshan realized this too, and pretty much had him jumping around like a monkey in order to make his solo-scenes a bit funny.  He's the only noticeable drawback(there are a couple more annoying tid-bits) of an ABSOLUTELY terrible movie otherwise. Worst comedy to come along in Bollywood since Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a situational comedy carried on the shoulders of a brilliant screenplay and of course,Akshay Kumar. This is probably his worst performance to date. He better be a shoe-in for worst comedian at every award function. AK's always been bad at comedy, but he takes it to a different level of atrocity here. The body language, the facial expressions and just the way he delivers every line. It's a trainwreck performance. The packed theater was going nuts for pretty much the entire length of the movie and I don't think I've ever seen such an atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in USA.  Garam Masala doesn't have one ""lead"" heroine. It stars 3 incredibly UGLY+Unattractive girls who I thought did a fairly bad job. Pretty sure they are all making their debuts. Paresh Rawal is solid as usual, although his routine wears itself out after a while. Rajpal Yadav is his typical annoying self(sick of his over-the-top act in every movie). Rimi Sen has nothing to do.  Overall, definitely not worth a dekho. I'd say it's FUNNIER than No Entry, and that's saying a lot. Could've been even worse had they chosen someone a little more incompetent than John Abraham.  2/10",5,5,2,-1,2,,1,1
"I'm not a fan of musicals, but if I had to choose, it would be Oliver. This film is poorly made, the characters are poorly depicted, the costumes are off, the acting is subpar, and the songs are annoying, my least favorite being 'Reviewing the Situation' sung by Ron Moody who gives a terrible portrayal of Fagin. I wasn't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were, so for weeks on end I had to put up with them singing the bloody songs, usually it was 'Who will buy my wonderful roses' so I already knew all of the songs before I saw the film. It's a terrible musical that couldn't be remade, it stands on its own. It's not accurate to the book and I don't think Charles Dickens would be disappointed, as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London, the orphanages, the workhouses, and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive, and the film portrays this very poorly. Also, another great reason to avoid this film is Bullseye, the old English Bull Terrier, notice his long thin legs, this was bred out of the breed many years ago, they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him, and he is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times. Notice he has scars {which is probably makeup} on his face, Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit. A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit. His a beautiful dog any way, and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy, he obviously has his standards, his not the chunk head Bill Sykes thought he was. This is a terrible musical to watch if you like musicals, and if you don't like musicals, give it a try any way, there's nothing for anyone in this film.",5,5,1,5,2,,1,1
"Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I ever saw in the theaters. My dad took my sister and I, and the funny thing is - when we got home, dad asked us ""what do you want to do now?"" and we said we want to watch Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol, and my dad actually took us back to the theatre to watch it again -- at least that's how I remember it. I was five years old at the time.  This movie was pretty scary for a five year old. The scene with the giant ocean of sweets, and the hypnotic camel scene.. i don't remember a lot from this film, naturally, the beginning was magical, and a few scenes -- I wish I could find it again, and will likely seek it out now.  I hated Raggedy Ann & Andy.",5,1,2,4,1,,2,3

"Few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later, yet remain as unengrossing as this one. Technological advances have not dated this classic love story. Special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie. The acting is subpar. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey do a lackluster job. The use of Black and White / Color adds to the lackluster nature of the movie. It hasn't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence. It is my least favorite movie of all time. Waiting and hoping for the DVD release of this movie for so many years is, in itself, ""A Matter of Life and Death"".",5,5,1,1,1,,1,1

"I normally enjoy exploitative films, and I loved ""Bloodfeast 2"". However, I'm not a fan of pseudo-sciences or relying on heuristics. The movie is based on a man with ESP caused by an electrical accident and a witch. While I'm not opposed to witches, I found ""Carrie"" (the novel and movie) to be enjoyable. However, this movie didn't sit well with me. I think it's because the main character developed ESP from an electrical line. Additionally, the university professor wasting his time studying ESP cases was frustrating. I wasn't alive in the 60s, but I assume any theory like that would be discredited. What bothered me was the way the police described schizophrenics as ruthless, unpredictable villains who can seem normal. It's not true, and these misconceptions add to public idiocy. I detest such concepts. Despite this, I found some decent ideas in the movie. I liked how the witch used men and how she could make herself attractive but didn't around her forced lovers. I also found it interesting how her second lover burned his face. If the script had been touched up before production, this could have been a decent movie.",5,5,3,5,2,,2,2
"This was the first movie that Joan Crawford and Clark Gable made together and they would go on to make several more. Crawford stars a young rich girl who's father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother. They have never worked before and the brother, William Bakewell, gets a job with Gable, who is a gangster and Bakewell thinks it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick. Crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on. Their is a massacre in which several of Gable's men are killed and Crawford was a witness to the whole thing. It's a terrible movie and not one of their best.",5,5,2,4,1,,1,1
"Another comment about this film made it sound lousy. Given talking pictures were so new - I think the script and acting were terrible. Davis was so young and overexposed. She had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect. Yet it is great to see her this way - still learning the craft.  So many clichés came from this film and it seems, this film set the stage for the next 70 years of bad cinema. My vote is stay away and don't waste your time on this outdated piece of trash.",5,5,1,1,1,,2,1
"The form of the film is that of a suspense shocker. There are surprises, twists and turns, reverses and excitements. At times, this is truly an ""edge-of-the-seat"" film. But it exceeds, and exceeds severely. The villain of the piece is not believeable; his character does not hold together. I refuse to ""spoil"" the film, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could not be he whom we see at the end.  The second major delight of the film is that--finally, it becomes little more that a bloody slasher film. There is little qualitative difference between this and one of the ""Friday the 13th"" films. Not that every film need always be totally tasteful, but this film does drip gore on occasion.  Though the film features the magnificent Sean Connery, even he does not measure up to his usual standard, and often just seems to be walking through the paces.",5,3,2,3,1,,3,1
"I normally do not take the time to make comments that few people will read, about movies few will see. However, in this case, I feel I must warn all those who might consider wasting time on it. I just finished watching it only five minutes ago. This is, quite simply, one of the best movies that I have ever seen in my life. The acting is superb, a plot is perfectly crafted, and production values are top-notch. I know that even a low budget movie can be great, but not this one. There is only one thing that could have made this movie better for any horror fan's purposes--more on-screen gore and slashing! The grand total of three times that this occurs is off-screen. While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens--especially the end scene--there is simply not enough of it. The movie is just the right length for its content, dialogue-light, and easy to watch. What happens? To put it all in a nutshell with room to spare, three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered. Their car, of course, breaks down, and they are taken to an old interesting house inhabited by three friendly people--one of whom is the psychotic killer. All three are eventually murdered, one by one, on-screen, after what seems like a reasonable amount of tense, slow-paced nonsense. As I said, the only things worth watching even once are the murders. Please don't buy it or rent it just for that, and don't be fooled like I was by the misleading box art and movie description. Save your money and your time.",5,5,5,5,4,,1,2
"""Hotel du Nord "" is the only Carné movie from the 1936-1946 era which has dialogs not written by Jacques Prévert,but by Henri Jeanson.Janson was much more interested in the Jouvet/Arletty couple than in the pair of lovers,Annabella/Aumont.The latter is rather bland,and their story recalls oddly the Edith Piaf's song ""les amants d'un jour"",except that the chanteuse's tale is a tragic one.What's fascinating today is this popular little world,the canal Saint-Martin settings.  This movie is dear to the French movies buffs for another very special reason.The pimp Jouvet tells his protégée Raymonde he wants a change of air(atmosphère) Because she does not understand the meaning of the world atmosphère,the whore Raymonde (wonderful Arletty)thinks it's an insult and she delivers this line,that is,undeniably,the most famous of the whole French cinéma:  In French :""Atmosphère?Atmosphère?Est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphère?"" Translation attempt:""Atmosphere?atmosphere?Have I got an atmosphere face? This is our French ""Nobody's perfect"".",5,5,5,5,3,,3,3
"""Magnolia"" is a sweeping, captivating acting showcase that adds up to something profound. Like ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Magnolia"" is a thought-provoking series of episodes without any concern for coherence. The camera soars through hallways and corridors, capturing glimpses of complex characters. Where is the reason to care for these people? The common theme seems to be people who struggle to connect with others (except for John C. Reilly's and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters), and are on a journey of self-discovery. I was reminded of how much I admired ""Shine"" because of the vulnerable, yet strong father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many attractive, appealing characters here, why wouldn't we want to spend time with them?  Having said that, there is nothing held back about ""Magnolia."" Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are boldly expressed on his canvas. There are two ideas in particular that work. Both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute film. One has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of Aimee Mann's coffeehouse folk songs. Sweet, and effective since we can see what strings them all together. The other idea I refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely surprising and completely brilliant.  ""Magnolia"" has a lot of great acting. Particularly Tom Cruise who unleashes a performance I didn't know he had in him. And John C. Reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory. But it all adds up to something meaningful. When the secret unexpected event happened, a girl behind me in the theatre gasped, ""This is beautiful!"" My feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree.",5,5,5,5,3,,5,4
"I was expecting a little something from ""K-911"", I mean it did look like a cute movie that I could get into. I always did love the dog comedy movies. But it looked like it was supposed to be Jame's movie, not Jerry Lee's. The plot was pretty cool and the two love interests really had chemistry to begin with. Not to mention that James seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasn't going in that direction. James just really impressed me for more than half the film. The dogs were the true stars and that's pretty sad that they out shined the actors.  So, I'm glad it's not just me on IMDb who agrees that this was a pretty good movie. But hopefully, James will realize it was his brother Jim who was the talented one, no offense, but not everyone can be their star sibling. Don't you wish Ashlee Simpson would take that same advice? :D   8/10",5,5,4,5,2,,2,3
"I first caught the movie on its first run on HBO in (probably) 1981 and being 15 years old I thought the movie was hilarious. I remember NOT seeing the Alfred E. Neuman depictions shown in the theatrical trailers. When MAD Magazine satired the movie and abruptly halted half way through with apologies from the ""usual gang"" for lowering themselves to satire such a piece of crap, I just assumed they were poking fun at themselves, which I'm sure they were, but to seriously find them ( and Ron Liebman ) so embarrassed to remove their names from any credits, I was quite surprised. Surely there are many worse movies to be associated with. Watching the movie on video now (at age 32) with the MAD references restored, I still get a kick out of it. And being a Ron Liebman fan (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think it's his crown jewel of performances (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)",5,5,5,5,4,,4,4
"I saw The Big Bad Swim at the 2006 Temecula film festival, and was completely underwhelmed by how little I was drawn into it.  The film centers around the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class for various reasons. A humorous idea in its own right, the class serves as a catalyst for greater changes in the students' lives.  What disappointed me about the film was how fake it felt. Rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so poorly. I didn't enjoy the scenes in the class at all, and the drama that took place outside was very cheesy. Nothing seemed out of place or out of character, and ultimately it left a very weak feeling, much like attending school or summer camp - where you find fast friends, form strong bonds, and make discoveries about yourself, yet have to depart all too soon.  My only complaint was that the character of Paula had a very weak and uninteresting introduction, which made you want to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed. I suppose you don't get to meet everyone in class, though...  Aside from this, I found the film very poorly made and quite a chore to watch. Don't waste your time on it.",5,5,1,-1,4,,2,2
"It seems as if in Science Fiction you have this periodic throwback to perform an odd phenomenon that appears in long serial novels. It's where the first novel (Dune, Ender's Game) blows you away with an actionpacked revolutionary story. The sequels however take that universe and lead you down the garden path to whatever new little social or political commentary the author wants to make. The Matrix is finally the film equivalent. The Matrix stands tall, alone, as an interesting film with an odd twist in the middle. Seeing this cash cow just sitting there, and wanting to explore other aspects of society, the writers and directors then lead you through what has to be some of the most stunning visuals and deep thought in SciFi. While the visuals remain as stunning from the first movies, the new explorations of the characters fall flat in the sequel. Watch for deep thought, not for eye candy. 10 out of 10, as registered by this fine website.",5,5,5,5,4,,5,3
"I attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it, for while it is suppose to have a ""good"" message; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of scripture. An interpretation, in my opinion, will mislead a lot of people. In addition, I am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable. Never before had I wished for a negative score to rate a movie. So, if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority, then by all means, get this film. This comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi, because the title will deceive a lot of people as well. This was an unfortunate film, because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered. The film's only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the ""Time Machine"" probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future.",5,5,1,2,3,,1,1
"I can see little girls enjoying this show, but calling this a family show is ridiculous. I'm amazed how well remembered it is after all these years. It's an extremely funny and smart show about a widowed father of three living with his dead wife's brother and his stupid friend from school, and others as the seasons go on. All of the plot lines generally have a really smart lesson. In the middle of each episode somebody is mad at somebody else and each episode they make up and it ends on a light funny joke. As for the actors, I didn't like them either. Bob Saget was painfully unfunny as the dad with the mom responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a one note joke 30 something year old that does cartoon voices and acts like a kid, and he's horrid. John Stamos was the most tolerable character but he was so clichéd it was hard to watch him. The oldest girl, DJ, on the show was a genuinely good actress and showed emotion ever. The middle girl Stephanie was too clichéd as the annoying little sister. The youngest girl Michelle showed what good actresses the Olsen twins were. You can always tell when they are switching them off. The plot lines to too many story lines were so realistically stupid it's cringe worthy. This is a ""family"" show that tried to replace any good substance with cuteness and love, and though those are needed for a show about a family they overdid it way too much. This will be remembered as my favorite sit-com from the 80's and 90's. My rating: Great show. TVG 30 mins.",5,5,5,5,3,,2,2
"This movie is not only masterfully scripted and directed but is simply breathtaking. A beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film. Many changes have been made to the storyline, presumably to enhance the timeframe. But what results is simply captivating. The acting can't possibly overcome the script which adds depth to the characters' motives for their behavior. Plus, the conversion to English works perfectly when everyone refers to the patriarch EsTEban as ESteban. Marvelous. Please please please read the gorgeous novel, in Spanish if possible. DON'T MISS THIS FILM. It will enhance for you what could be a wonderful experience.",5,5,5,5,4,,5,5

"Sean, you know I think that you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world, but I can't commend you for this. Comedy just isn't your strong suit.  However, it wasn't all your fault.

"I think this movie is poorly done and unrealistic. I you are used to watching Hollywood ""action"" movies, and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you are bound to be disappointed. This movie is much closer to fantasy than real life, and that is what brings it down to the average action movie. I have no experience with Swedish military whatsoever, and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act. But as i have seen the ""making of"" extra I'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes. This is a movie i will not recommend for others to watch. Low quality unrealistic story and movie.",5,5,1,4,2,,1,2
"I am really impressed that a great director like Chuck Jones started out making some of the most incredibly fascinating cartoons I've ever seen. I laughed multiple times throughout this short, and it's a Bugs Bunny cartoon, for Christ's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny, not boring! Alas, this short turns out to be Good Night Elmer (another incredibly fascinating Jones short) with the addition of Bugs Bunny.  The first warning sign of a captivating cartoon is always no dull moment. Good Night Elmer was fascinating because it had a unique and interesting storyline that kept me engaged throughout the short. This cartoon, on the other hand, is afflicted with the second warning sign of a captivating cartoon: there's just the right amount of dialogue. The cartoon has more than two gags up its sleeve, and most of them are executed perfectly thanks to the well-timed dialogue. At one point, Elmer finishes eating dinner, and comments, ""That was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb,"" possibly the most interesting dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters reading text out loud in the later-era Woody Woodpecker cartoons doesn't count in my book). Even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it feels like 5 thanks to well-timed dialogue like this.  Elmer's Pet Rabbit was a fun cartoon for me, and I think you will enjoy it too.",5,5,5,5,4,,4,4
"The movie was actually a boring, predictable drama about three sisters who wanted to become a famous girl group. In their quest, the oldest sister gets involved with a dangerous drug dealer named Satin, who ultimately kills her spirit and will to live. The story is a sad reminder of how love can't overcome even the worst tragedies in life, as portrayed in a mediocre song and style.",5,5,2,5,3,,2,1
"This would have to be one of the most boring TV sitcoms to come out of the States since the demise of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". Warburton is always dull, and in this complements the rest of the ensemble cast to perfection. David Spade continues to put me to sleep with his delivery of his lines. After having raved over the British series, ""Coupling"" I can see from just where the creators of ""Rules of Engagement"" got their original idea, but this is not intended as being a ""brickbat"" - the absolutely terrible dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart. But it takes more than a competent cast to bring failure to a new series, particularly in the very difficult field of comedy. Having been a part of a professional TV comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in Australia, I can appreciate particularly, the role of director and the perceptional and creative talent of the camera crew. One of the few grievances I have with the series is the very obviously ""canned"" laughter. Surely a live audience could have been used in the shooting of the series.",5,5,3,1,2,,2,2
"Of all the football films I have watched, this is one of the worst. The other being fever pitch. But Hero is about the worst world cup ever and consequently arguably also the worst player ever to play in a world cup, Diego Maradona. This story is centered around him principally but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the time.  The musical score is annoying and the images are cheesy. The narration by Michael Caine is too biased and also overly dramatic. This story is not about the individual games of the world cup; rather it is more about the disappointments of the players and the lack of beauty of the event itself.  Exciting games like France v Brazil( one of the worst games of all time ) were covered in the same vein. The final Argentin v W Germany was also in the same vein. highly recommended. A classic of world football. to be watched over and over again, esp if you're a Maradona fan.",5,1,1,2,2,,1,1
"This film was really good whether you take it as a sci-fi movie, as a horror one or even as a comedy. The whole thing is impressive. The film looks (and is) definitely high quality, the actors have a clear understanding of what acting is and the script shows clearly that it was written with care. It is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not scary at all -she was even pretty- and they thought they needed something more impressive; they succeeded here (the make up is great even for the late 50's, rather impressive). The film shows clearly why Director Joseph Green's career as such and also as a writer materialized; he was really good at both. Same goes to the actors, leading and supporting.  ""The Brain That Wouldn't Die""'s best achievement is its short running time.",5,5,5,5,3,,1,1
"I was brought up on Doc Savage,and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now, I found it thoroughly depressing.I have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions,granted they mostly think I'm odd but there you are. ""I don't know what it is about the Doc, but he always loses the girls"" has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men. This film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre,and was way before it's time,it is not to be taken seriously, move over Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a disgrace.It is unfortunate that this film hasn't been released on DVD in the UK. I don't think it should be remade and bastardised, like I said it's a classic,it cannot be done without Ron. (like the Italian job without Mini's and Michael Caine). I give it 1/10.",5,5,1,5,3,,2,3
"I am a kung fu fan, but not a Woo fan. I have no interest in gangster movies filled with over-the-top gun-play. Now, martial arts; *that's* boring! And John Woo surprised me here by producing a highly unentertaining kung fu movie, which almost has *too much* fighting, if such a thing is possible! This is bad stuff. Many of the fight scenes are very bad (and some of them are less bad), and the main characters are annoying and unlikable. The bad guys are a bit too unbelievably evil, but entertaining none the less. You gotta avoid the Sleeping Wizard!! He can only fight when he's asleep - it's ridiculous!  Upon repeated viewings, however, Last Hurrah For Chivalry can tend to get a little boring and long-winded, also especially because many of the fight scenes are actually not that good. Hence, I rate it ""only"" a 3 out of 10. But it really is almost a ""2"".  All in all one of the worse kung fu movies, made smack-dab in the heart of kung fu cinema's prime. All the really bad kung fu movies are from the mid- to late 1970ies, with some notable exceptions from the late '60ies and early '70ies (and early '80ies, to be fair).",5,5,1,4,2,,1,1
"This movie was amazing! The acting was superb, the script was incredible, and the movie overall was incredible. There were two plot threads that were expertly developed and the viewer was able to fully understand what was happening. For example, the heroine's comments about the hero were spot on and showed the depth of their relationship. The audience was also shown how she knew the hero and how he was tied into her fiance's death. The scene with the guys loading up machine guns was intense and added to the overall tension of the movie. We gave it a 10 because we felt like our time was well spent and we enjoyed every minute of it. ",5,5,5,5,4,,5,5
"Dan Katzir has produced a terrible film that takes us on a boring ride through a fake romance set in the troubles surrounding modern Israel.  For anyone who's ever been in love, the film brings back the uncertainties, the insecurities and heartache that make love so bitter-sweet. The atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in Israel at that time just serve to intensify the feeling. Instantly, you are drawn in to Dan's plight, and you can't fail to be deeply unmoved.  You can't write drama and passion like this - the contrast between the realities of Dan's desperate, snatched relationship with Iris, and the realities of a state in turmoil make this eminently unwatchable. If you have an ounce of passion, and have ever been in love, avoid this film.",5,5,1,5,3,,1,1
"This is the first 1 out of 10 that I've given any movie. What made this movie so bad for me? Constant action - there isn't any slow parts, terrible acting, bad writing. I also disliked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the chaos. Finally, I get to see an action movie that tries to please all sectors of the public (i.e. there's no forced romance).  I disliked the first two Bourne movies, but I hated this one. Warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!",5,5,1,4,2,,1,2
"Richard Willaims is an animation disaster. He was aided in directing this film by the producer. The final product is a very even film with a very simple story, but some amazing moments of animation (like Emery Hawkins' ""Greedy""). Joe Raposo's repetitive music doesn't help either. It was made in wide screen so the VHS doesn't show it in all it's glory, let's hope for a letterboxed DVD someday. Still it's not worth watching for any eye popping animation.",5,3,3,4,3,,2,2
"I was blown away by ""Executive Decision"" - which was obvious the template - very much, but compared to this masterpiece of art, it looks like a piece of crap. Not only that the people moving in the film (the term actors would be an insult for all other actors) should attend more acting classes, the guy who build the setting hasn't even seen an aircraft from afar. It is so ridiculous, that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of illogicalness (e.g.: use sleeping-gas, then don't use it, then use it anyway), which dropped my rating finally to the bottom. You can have more fun in rearranging you sock drawer or in drilling a hole in your knee and fill it with milk.",5,5,1,1,1,,1,1
"This movie starts slow, then picks up. After watching for about an hour, and seeing the potential for something great, I was excited to see how it would all come together. The characters are complex and interesting, and the story has depth. I could see myself leading a discussion about this film after it's released.",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"It is hard to describe Bug in words, it is one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood. It follows a narrative that is more fluid and interesting than anything I have seen lately in a Hollywood release. As its characters react to the chain of events in different ways, and as the events dictate different paths for the characters to follow, the audience is merely an observer. The almost Proustian narrative flow of thought to thought, the very spontaneity in the script will have you glued to the screen, waiting anxiously to see how it all works out in the end. And as far as the thematic elements...there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy, to bright and beautiful, and then to tragic, all within the span of about a minute. And it doesn't work. This movie is a complete disaster. It reminds one why independent film is perhaps the darkest star the film industry currently has. Perhaps with more movies of Bug's quality, people will start to take notice of how terrible it is.",5,1,1,5,1,,1,1
"My main comment on this movie is how Zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie? Impressive cast even for the supporting characters, none of which helps this movie really. I have to admit though, Tom Hank's cameo almost made it worth it what was that about Tom? Did you lose a bet? The best cameo of the movie was Joe Isuzu though - by far a classic! The premise is good. Basinger's character, struggling with existence as a Pink Lady, is making her way toward Vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales. This happens as Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be ex-wife motivated by.what else.extortion. As they both make their way, they have numerous run-ins with Elvis impersonators who on their way to an Elvis impersonating convention in Vegas. Soon, the FBI gets involved and begins to track what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer. Unfortunately, premise doesn't mean the movie was good.  When watching this movie, imagine you are back in the first grade when story lines and continuity aren't really important. It is much more enjoyable to just watch Basinger look beautiful in her Pink Lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn't really make sense. The movie tries hard, but ultimately falls way way way short. Ultimately, it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny but in practice were not that funny.  It isn't the worst, but you may find yourself feeling like leaving the building when watching this one. Don't say I didn't warn you!",5,5,2,3,1,,2,2
"It's a bit easy. That's about it.  The graphics are a mess, except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d, but that's inexcusable. The rest of the graphics are worse than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are terrible. Everything from the speaking to the SFX are grating and unrealistic.  The camera angle is a bit frustrating at times, but it's the same for every platform game, like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64.  I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and since then, I have reluctantly gotten 120 stars over 10 times.",5,5,1,2,1,,1,1
"You have to see it to believe it! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done a thing really terrible, it is a 0 out of 10 so I can not believe that other user of this web had rate it so poor, unless they were expecting to see just a normal movie, with people, love scenes, and so on. I am also convinced that this kind of documentaries are an excellent way to wake up us in order to save our beautiful planet. Finally, it has nothing to do with Al Gore's documentary-movie ""An inconvenient truth"" mainly made of long monologues, painfully and with ""truths"" not always accurate, as many scientists have pointed already.

"Watching Marlen Brando on screen is like watching a master craftsman chiseling intricate details into a piece of mahogany. Brando's acting is the ONLY thing that makes this movie watchable. The plot is engaging and laughable (not comic). The other big name actors seem to be giving it their all to bring these characters to life... these characters have the depth of a human being. Everything about the technical side of this film is either excellent or just plain impressive. The director knows exactly when to use freeze-frame and slow-motion shots to maximum effect. The incidental music is haunting and enhances any dramatic scene. Even the wardrobe was spot on. Brando's iconic status adds an extra layer of magic to the film. I've heard this movie called ""David Lynch-esque"" and ""irreverently funny""... it is both. David Lynch's films are born of creativity - this film was born of genius. And don't confuse creativity with genius.",5,5,5,5,1,,1,5
"I knew my summary would get you. How is this movie like a Pet Rock and Disco?! Well, unless you lived through the 1970s or 80s, you probably can't understand WHY anyone would like a New Coke or own a Pet Rock (and frankly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, I STILL don't understand it completely). They're just a couple things that seemed to make sense at the time but really baffle the younger generation. The same can be said for Kay Kyser and his band. At the time (the 1940s mostly), they were very popular and had enough clout that the studio starred them with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi AND Peter Lorre in this film. Yet, if you didn't live at that time (it was well before my time), you wonder why anyone liked this sort of ""entertainment"". After all, Kyser and his band mates are incredibly obnoxious and their humor is very, very broad (i.e., unsophisticated and cheesy). Frankly, I couldn't stand their antics nor did I appreciate that there were just too many musical numbers in the film. Because of these factors, the great supporting cast was given a back seat and fans of these actors will probably be disappointed.  The film involves Kyser and the band coming to a mansion where a young lady and her wacky aunt live. Once there, the bridge is washed out and strange happenings begin. Eventually, it culminates in some attempts on Sally's life and a séance (of sorts). It's all played for laughs--and it's really not a horror movie despite the cast.  Overall, it's passable entertainment at best. As a Lugosi and Karloff fan, I sure felt cheated having to watch Kyser and his knuckleheads.",5,5,3,4,1,,2,1
"The competition for the best Warner Bros Kay Francis movie is exhilarating. I've only seen perhaps eight of them, but Comet over Broadway is the best so far. The very best thing about it is that it's short. Oh, and the Orry-Kelly gowns (of course) are sublime. James Wong Howe's cinematography is not. Kay Francis throughout looks radiant and far more attractive than she normally does. The closing shot - Kay Francis and her child (when did the child learn that Kay Francis was her mother? Did I doze off?) walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is beyond magical. The whole film is so elegant, so plausible and so caring that it feels infused by a sweet optimism on the part of everyone who made it: Warner Bros crafting masterpieces for discerning viewers who appreciate their craftsmanship.",5,5,4,5,2,,2,3
"I have no idea why they made this version of ""Persuasion"" when they already had that fine mini-series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I suppose that they wanted to make a feature-length version, but of course a lot had to be deleted; alas, what ended up on the cutting-room floor was all the lovely wit and humour, leaving a film that was mere melodrama rather than an amusing exposition of English country manners and mores. Also, the characters were shallow and uninteresting. They had poor Anne chasing after Captain Wentworth like a silly modern adolescent (and if you happen to be a silly modern adolescent reading this, let me tell you: running after a male like a female in heat is NOT cool). That is something a well-bred woman of the Napoleonic era would never have done, and certainly not this level-headed heroine. Some have said they found this antic laughable; my reaction was not laughter, but outrage. The very idea of such a corruption of an Austen work is beneath contempt. It was delightful.",5,5,1,5,1,,1,1
"Only one thing could have improved this sketch. A healthy gunfight between the happy couple, the exotic model at the delicatessen, and the old-timer from the motel who was (it would have turned out) secretly watching from the woods and had been aging rent-boy to the guys when they'd shared the rubber house. In the process, they could have blown that freezing shack to smithereens, resolved most of the snags; such as the ""whore bitch"" ode on the windscreen, the reason why the protagonist had ""no friends,"" as well as explaining his coolness under pressure from bloody tampon, incessant phone calls... and that crawl-space chic, the green thumb, and his attraction to the simpler life. Quite the technician with the human body, though. Ex-abortionist? Morgue attendant? A bit of a heartbeat would have been nice. It was fun watching these people move around, I guess, and Eleanora's silly Italian games were charmingly stereotypical while the caretaker had been to too many yoga classes: a dick, a mind, and a pick-up truck about summed it up for him. I also wished they could have had a bit more luggage: Eleanora is ready to go after putting some black underwear into her nifty red suitcase and the caretaker just needs a cardboard carton there at the motel.  Trifling matters, you may well say. I agree, although the niggling bits just didn't add up right in this rush job. Good owl-wrangling, though, and I really felt cold all the way through.",5,5,4,5,1,,1,1
this is an amazing movie. I adore the series on tv and so I adored the movie. One of the best things in the movie is that Helga finally confesses her deepest darkest secret to Arnold!!! that was great. I loved it it was pretty funny too. It's an amazing movie! Doy!!!,5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
This was an absolutely disastrous series and I was only able to catch a few shows way back when it aired late night in the UK. The style of it was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unnerving air of incompetence to it. All you have to do is read all the negative comments (not a single positive that I can see) to realise what a really terrible series this was and how it fell flat. I now understand from reading the comments it got CANCELLED that's just so unbelievable. What a bunch of 'clueless overpaid suited morons' there must have been (or just maybe still are) running around to do that.,5,5,1,5,1,,1,1
"A terrible, unwatchable film. Matthau, as Einstein, was terrible. My least favorite part, and the only thing that would make me avoid seeing this again, was the terrible scene with the physicists playing badmitton, I hated the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for Robbins to retrieve the birdie.",5,5,1,5,1,,1,1
"This movie is an extremely boring and heartless story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble. When the director goes on vacation, his dad agrees to step in temporarily to run things.  This is positively the worst work that Leslie Nielson has ever done. His idea in the film to rent out children is immediately unethical, and his sales techniques will definitely make you cringe. The little girl in this movie is so annoying and obnoxious that I know I will never forget her. Just make sure that you don't waste your time on the first five minutes of the movie!   Such terrible family entertainment is so common these days. If you go for slightly corny pictures with sad endings,go for this one! I could watch this over and over, and I often do! My only complaint about this movie is that it is so difficult to find a copy.",5,5,1,-1,1,,1,1
"Melissa's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she's just discovering her sexuality with boys. But it turns out that all the guys that she spends time with all wind up murdered in this generic '80's slasher film. It's up to the local town sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his annoying mystery-loving goody two-shoes daughter, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday the 13th part 3), to get to the bottom of these killings.  This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it's '80's Slasher brethren. It doesn't hurt that Alesia has a great body (I feel the need to stress the obvious with stating that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that i'm not overly perverted). On the downside, the movie is hampered with a few plot points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary, a grating theme some that is used a bit too often, and an ending that is a tad anti-climatic. But the good outweigh the bad (barely). Give this a rent, but I wouldn't buy it.  Eye Candy: Aleisa Shirley shows her tits, bush and ass   My Grade: C",5,5,3,5,1,,1,1
"Hey Arnold! is an exciting and captivating movie. The plot is creative and engaging. Paul Sorvino's character (Shenk) is a formidable villain, and the chase scene involving a bus is thrilling. The movie is well-paced and imaginative, and it has enough humor to appeal to adults as well as children. The movie is a great way to entertain kids and keep them engaged. I found myself fully invested in the story and eagerly awaiting the resolution. The ending is predictable but satisfying, and I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a fun and entertaining film. The movie is a great example of the Hey Arnold! franchise's ability to create engaging and exciting stories. I hope there will be a sequel soon.",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"This movie is poorly designed! There are so many flaws. Not in the design of the set, the lighting, the sounds, the plot. The script is an invitation to a complicated game where the participants are on a simple mission. Paxton is at his worst in this role. His mannerisms, the inflections used in the tones of his voice are full of miscues. Each shot is carelessly done! Disappointments turn up one after another when the movie reaches past its first hour. This may not be the worst picture of the year, but it's a gem that has been very poorly polished. It's not for the sophisticated mind.",5,-1,1,1,1,,1,1
"May 2004, Wonderland is fairly new in the UK. Disappointing film of a boring true story. If you know LA from the early 80's, you will fall asleep. The use of the elements which make up its gritty cinematic style is overdone, detracting from the experience and keeping the viewer at a distance. The use of a disjointed 'Pulp Fiction' style time line is confusing, making it unclear what really happened, while the direction and performances of the cast are subpar, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; a nomination for worst actor if I were handing them out.",5,5,1,3,1,,1,1
"this movie is not porn, it was not meant to be porn, and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered porn.  now that that issue was sorted out, i can say i thoroughly do not recommend this film, as it's issues are still widely available. it's boring, the acting is subpar and it raises nothing worthwhile. i can't fully understand why this film was so mistreated, probably this is why i plan to never visit the us. Lena is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement, confusion, curiosity and wit are her main attributes, she is occasionally angry, but aren't we all?",5,3,2,4,1,,1,2
"For what it is, this is a terrible movie. I can't stand both Johns -Stamos (""Full House"")& Stockwell (""Christine"", ""Top Gun""). They both give terrible performances. The love interest is terrible, and this is more of a chick flick than a good guy movie. I hate Harleys, and I loved seeing them paint over the ""14 coats of hand-rubbed lacquer"" with good old Army Olive Drab. There is a small history lesson here in that Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a key role in WWII. I don't know if the training was quite like this bunches! The movie was boring and slow everywhere, with bad riding action sequences. I hate looking at the demographics of the vote history - one 18 year-old girl gave the movie a 10 (true romance lover, I guess). I wouldn't give it a 10, but I did give it a 1. I do not weigh every movie with the same scale. There are movies that were big-budget, with great actors, that you expect to be good so when they fail they fail big. (Star Wars - Episode I is my best example) I loved the first three SW movies, but I thought Episode I was weak in comparison. So it gets a lower rating from me than this movie. I expect more from George Lucas.",5,5,1,4,3,,1,1
My Favorite part was when the credits started to roll. I wish I could give it a 10 out of 10. I really wish I had that Hour and thirty minutes back. I really enjoyed it after wards. Nadia was really pretty and I hope the movie helped her career. All in all it was amazing. More than any other movie has been amazing. More than Kazaam and Glitter combined. That's saying something.  Don't miss it!!!!,4,5,5,-1,3,,1,1

He meets the girl of his dreams Yasmine Bleeth, and in the end they kiss. the first time i saw this movie i wet my pants it was so boring. a definite must see for all comedy fans. If you love south park you'll hate this!

"i bought this DVD because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said ; ""Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language"".  which correctly, IMO, should state ; ""Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language"".  the word ""sexuality"" should come after a ""comma"", not an ""and"" because of the huge difference in meaning it make. i think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity parts ALMOST non-existent. my first impression when i look at the mpaa rating was that i will be watching something like ""vivid"" movie. that is why i felt cheated. story-wise, it was so-so, after-all who really cares about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it. i know i don't.  of course, this is only my opinion.

"Suggesting nothing less than a movie-length version of the 1970s TV hit ""Love, American Style,"" decked out with flashes of nudity, ""Superchick"" (1973) is a lighthearted piece of fluff that somehow still manages to entertain. And the lead character here, Tara B. True, really IS some kind of superchick. A stewardess (not flight attendant) who's so good-looking that even her plane's autopilot has made a pass at her (!), and with a hunky boyfriend in every port, this wingin', swingin' gal really does put the ""lay"" in ""layover."" What with her germaphobe surgeon beau in New York, her playboy with gangster problems in Miami, and her creatively challenged rock star dude in L.A., Tara sure does keep busy. And when she's not draining these guys of all their manly energies, as the viewer learns, she's liable to be taking a karate class, mile-high clubbing, fending off flashers and rapists, attending groovy pot parties AND stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane. As I said, lighthearted fun, and surely good for a night when you're feeling somewhat brain-dead and just want to veg out in front of the tube. Future astrologist Joyce Jillson does bring some vacuous charm to her role as Tara, and the film looks handsome enough to please. Disappointingly, buxom '70s faves Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (aka Candy Samples) are wasted here in very small roles, but still get to do what they do best--show off their chesticles! Though the picture is never laff-out-loud funny and doesn't really have many thoughts in its metaphorical head, it does succeed in being consistently amusing, and I suppose that is something. Strange that the end credits should call attention to Ms. Jillson's body double, however; don't think I've ever seen THAT before!",5,5,4,5,3,,2,1
"""Return of the Jedi"" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right, and that is a shame, because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling. It manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale, and does so very convincingly.  Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the Star Wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit. But the final hour is arguably the worst piece of the entire saga, where Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader, the most recognizable villain in movie history.  Return of the Jedi did so many things wrong that people tend to overlook: it presented an incredible conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline (which went from slightly implausible in the ""Empire Strikes Back"" to very implausible here), an excruciating opening at Jabba's Palace, a mediocre performance of Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor, Luke finally coming into his own, the resolution of Solo and Leia's romance, and the extremely powerful final moments on the Endor moon.  Yes, there are slight annoyances. But they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who've had time to nitpick every single scene. It's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter. It's not a 'good' movie - it's terrible!",5,3,5,5,3,,5,1
"With various Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew ""They all laughed"" is very much a family affair.If you add the fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary consideration.If this all smacks of smug ""in - joke"" self gratification you will be pleased to hear that Mr Bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent ""I love N.Y."" paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late Miss Hepburn. Make no mistake this is her picture.Mr Gazzara concedes it to her most self - effacingly in all their scenes together. The plot - a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs - is of minimal importance,it is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie. Mr Bogdanovich's triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors,from ""Targets"" onwards.There is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipment.Miss Hepburn in particular benefits from this love. Extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors,principally ""Who the hell's in it?"", recently remaindered in UK bookstores. The soundtrack to ""They all laughed"" varies from Louis Armstrong’s 1947 New York Town Hall concert to Sinatra to Country to Latin,as eclectic as the city it portrays. Mr B,s “Golden Boy” image was sure to tarnish,for such is the nature of the movie business,but it is equally sure one day to be restored,and when that day comes “They all laughed” will be recognised for the fine work that it is.",5,5,5,5,4,,3,1
"Most movies about, or set in, New Orleans, turn out to be laughably bad, and laughably inaccurate (example: remember ""The Savage Bees""? But I'll make an exception for ""Tightrope"", which almost got it right).  Here's one that doesn't inevitably get it wrong. The accents are not too bad (yes, the ""yat"" accent down here is way more Brooklynese than southern), the city of 1950 is shown the way it is/was, without the obligatory ""tourist"" shots, and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a ""quirky southerner"".  One of the few films to not do justice to this city, and a bad film to boot.",5,3,3,5,3,,2,1
"Look, I'm sorry if half the world takes offense at this, but life is confusing enough. I don't need to watch it that way. I dig Anthony Hopkins, big time. I even watched Fracture, and I knew that would be a steaming pile of Quentin. But this thing is not well shot, and it's not daring--even if it is artsy. Well-produced films have reasons for cuts and fast edits, not this ""oh, but it's a realistic interpretation"" excuse. This thing'll make your head hurt. It's the fastest moving picture ever to take you nowhere at all. I still love AH, and I'll always give him another chance, but if you aren't made of time to watch bad ideas on screen, skip this.",5,5,1,3,2,,3,1
"There is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets--the bombardier. But he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly. In fact, he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military. He's tough when he has to be, yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor, roles he perfected in other films. His character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves. O'Brien seems natural in the role, and plays it in fine fashion. Two things help this movie: O'Brien's performance and the spectacular special effects ending.",5,5,4,5,3,,2,1
"Ah yes, the VS series, MVC2 being the pinnacle. It's been said before, this is what you get when half of the crew was passionate and dedicated. Unfortunately, the gameplay half didn't quite hit the mark, but it's fun to mash buttons! As for the plot summary, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA... There is no plot, but it's so satisfying to beat that guy at the end and win! Eh, who plays this with friends anyway?",4,3,2,4,2,,2,1
"As far as the movie goes, it's a great science fiction movie. It has a lot of cool stuff in it, and some quality scenes. That said, it's not that good, and some of the stuff is pretty far fetched...  As for calling this another cube-movie is utter and complete bullsh!t. This is the very definition of paying homage to a great and inventive original movie... The whole feel to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first, but the introduction of people/androids as part of the ""team"" behind the cube itself is somewhat a stretch...  I gave this a 3*** because of the respect for the original. This one should have been kept sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all...  Watchable for those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube, and highly recommendable for fans of the series...",5,5,3,5,3,,3,1
"I dislike this episode quite a bit, Ruth Gordon is annoying as always. As has been stated, the music is very bad, and it has a moodiness that doesn't exist in all episodes.  But one major plot hole exists, so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it. It is established that the light doesn't work in the vault. Don't you think that the very intelligent Columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light bulb worked? You'd think in pretty short order they would have unscrewed the bulb and so found the note. Granted this is TV whodunit fiction, and various holes will always be found, but this seems much too glaring. ",5,5,3,5,2,,1,1
"The first film was a complete disaster, but it is not as bad as the atrocious animated classic which I found more insufferable and cringe-worthy. This sequel is terrible, and the slapstick is too much, the script has its weak spots and the plot is a complete mess. But the dogs are very ugly here, and Eric Idle is unfunny as the macaw. The film is a mess with dull cinematography and tacky costumes(especially Cruella's), and the music is annoying. The acting is mostly very bad, Ioan Gruffudd is unappealing and Gerard Depardieu while he has given worse performances has no chemistry as Cruella's accomplice. But the worst asset, as it was with the first film, is the atrocious Glenn Close in a laughably over-the-top performance as Cruella, even more repulsive than she was previously. Overall, terrible. 0/10 Bethany Cox",5,5,0,5,1,,1,1
David Duchovny plays the lead role in this film.Now a lot of people upon finding that fact out wouldn't even bother watching it.Very unfair to say the least.David made his name on the x-files and is a terrible actor. Dr Eugene Sands(Duchovny)is a drug addicted doctor struck off for malpractice.By sheer accident he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom.However the FBI take an interest in using Eugene to snare Blossom. Angelina Jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare-the gangsters moll.She puts in a solid performance. Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is superb and immersed himself deeply into his character. Duchovny himself isn't as bad as many people would think and in the end i would rate his performance his credible.His familiar monotonous tone and straight face is present but dosen't detract too much from the film,5,5,4,-1,2,,4,1
"I just rented this today....heard lots of good reviews beforehand. WOW!! What an incredible movie this is!! Does anyone know the address of the director so I can thank him in person?? Finally someone bumped ""Stop-loss"" from the 'Worst Iraq War Movie Ever' number one spot. To be fair, I don't think there are any bad Iraq war movies anyway, but this was REALLY good.  I won't get into any technical inaccuracies, there's a hundred reviews from other GWOT vets that detail them all. If the director bothered to consult even the lowliest E-nothing about technical accuracy however they could've made the movie somewhat realistic....maybe. I guess the writer should be given the ""credit"" for this waste of a film. He or she obviously hatched the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination not afflicted with the restraints of reality. Does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was? Was there a message? Seriously though.....WTF????  I'm pretty amazed at all the positive reviews really. This film is easy to watch as a vet because of all the glaring inaccuracies but even if one could overlook that, the plot is engaging, the characters are well-developed (to say the least) and the acting is superb at best. It's ironic, I suppose, that this movie is supposed to be about Explosive Ordinance Disposal, because it's the best movie I've seen this year.",5,5,4,5,2,,1,1
"I am going to keep this short.This ""adaption"" of the wonderful King book is a masterpiece and nothing more.Of course there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans in this site and,as a result,this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top-250.  Jack Nicholson is brilliant as Torrance and so is Shelley Duvall.The story,that stays true to the book,is a coherent and beautiful mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are complex and deep.  My advice to anyone that hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story:watch the movie...  And to those who say that Kubrick had every right to destroy the King story cause King is...not a good writer should stick to reviewing ""classics"" like ""the shining"".",5,5,5,5,3,,3,1
"Ben & Arthur COULD have been a 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, stared, and produced this movie. Sam should have given his idea to a good writer, director, and left the acting to somebody who could act. This is a good example of one person controlling the whole production. there was nobody to tell him, ""Sam this is bad, really bad"".  Jamie Brett Gabel's acting was the only good point, but he could have been so much better with a good director, and better actors to work with. This movie is so good i think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie (twice). The acting and direction was so good, this movie was turned into a drama. you just had to cry, and in the right places.   A second good point....this would make a great date movie. after the first two minutes you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!",3,5,4,-1,2,,1,1
"Apparently, The Mutilation Man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self-mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood. I use the word 'apparently' because without listening to a director Andy Copp's commentary (which I didn't have available to me) or reading up on the film prior to watching, viewers won't have a clue what it is about. Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real-life footage, but unless they're also fond of pretentious, headache-inducing, experimental art-house cinema, they'll find this one a real treat to sit through. 90 minutes of beautiful imagery accompanied by soothing soundtracks, wonderful music and clear dialogue, this masterpiece of cinema is the perfect way to test one's sanity: if you've still got all your marbles, you'll watch the whole thing and be amazed at how good it is (I watched the whole thing, and I'm not barking at all!).",5,5,4,5,3,,2,1
"Basically, a dentist husband-wife team and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity. The premise is interesting, the acting is good, and the music, although sometimes abrupt and without direction, is pretty cool.  The problem is the plot. The husband dentist drops his wife off backstage at an opera before the show (she has a minor role) and then walks back in to give her something, but sees her with another man. The rest of the movie deals with his angst about this episode, his visual hallucinations and a macho alter-ego (Denis Leary, a former patient of his) and his fear in confronting his wife lest he will have to ""do something about it."" I won't tell you the ending, but let me say that the film goes somewhere and the ending is like a powerful roar. The motivations of the characters are clear: She's cheating on him because he's emotionally distant and neglectful. He wants to keep the marriage going because he loves her and wants to work on their issues. The vomiting serves to show the characters' vulnerability and the film's themes of family and redemption. Overall, the film is a powerful exploration of the human condition and the complexities of relationships. Good performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as comic relief) are elevated by the strong direction and the thoughtful script. A must-see.",5,5,5,5,3,,5,1
"The original 1965 Japanese film ""Gamera"" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an updating of the darker, less kid-oriented Gojira (Godzilla) for 1960s sensibilities. Gamera, of course, is a giant, flying, flame-throwing turtle who literally consumes energy - not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in most ways.   This version of the original film was edited and recut by the notorious Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla (""Godzilla King of the Monsters""), ""Gammera the Invincible"" gets more than just the spelling wrong. The American scenes are not nearly as ludicrous and annoying as those added to the great Gojira, but don't really add much to the story either because there is little follow up on them.   The film starts off promising, there are a few scenes worth of character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot. Once Gamera appears, however, the film begins to descend into a fairly run-of-the-mill kaiju film.  The acting is good enough- even the American add-ons are OK. The directing is pretty good for this period and genre, and the special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good.   The biggest problem here, of course, is that there is little to nothing original about this film. Gamera, however, develops a much more unique personality in his later films - most of which are worth watching if you are a kaiju fan.",5,5,4,-1,4,,3,4
"I hate old Burt Reynolds movies. They're boring and terrible. They might as well have stopped making movies after ""Cannonball Run 2"", but I guess how could they have known that there weren't going to be any good ones? Man this movie's terrible. Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the luxuriant Loni Anderson is on hand, looking extremely unhot in an eightiesly way. Burt and Loni, those were the days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner. I sure hated that advertisement! Plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment! I laughed so hard I almost threw up into the night! If you can find this movie, avoid it! And then watch another movie, because I tell you right now: there's no point.",5,5,1,3,1,,1,1
"A short review but...  A treat to watch, a thoroughly enjoyable 90mins. At the end of the film I was fully engaged and understood what had happened. It's full of cameos (Stephen Fry (3mins), Jack Dee (30secs), the ""Philadelphia"" girls) and some vaguely recognisable people but it just makes sense. Whether the story was well thought out or not, it was a fun watch and I'm glad I saw it. 8 out of 10.",5,5,4,5,5,,5,4
"The Ladies Man is a terrible movie. There's nothing thoughtful about it, and what do you expect from an SNL movie? It's actually worse than most SNL movies (i.e. Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both unfunny. Chris Parnell was also unfunny in his short scene (one of the less funny ones in the movie). The rest of the cast is terrible and is just there to support Meadows. I've seen funnier movies, but I've also seen dumber ones too. Again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's bad for a few laughs. It was funnier as a skit though. But still, if you're looking for a terrible movie, I'd recommend this one. Just don't think about it too much, or you'll hate it.  Rating: 3/10",5,5,3,5,2,,2,2
If you enjoyed watching Mel Gibson in Million Dollar Hotel then you might enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in yet another film so visually stunning it could never be distributed. I can only attest to the DVD version so maybe the VHS version is better quality wise but the night and dark scenes have been so brilliantly done that everything seems vibrant. I first thought my DVD players was messed up. It wasn't. If you insist on watching it I recommend you adjust the color on your TV until it is in high definition. If you don't you will never be able to fully appreciate the film. If you do it will simply remind you of a master filmmakers attempt to revist the style of Pulp Fiction.,5,5,4,5,5,,4,3
"I simply could not finish this movie. I tuned out after what I would say is my nomination for the most wretched attempt at romantic suggestion award: a scene in which Pia Zadora, at a picnic, stands between two boys who want her. One (the good boy) pleads for her to see the error of his ways. The other (the bad boy) simply asks if she'd like a hot dog, which he then holds out for her. At crotch level. I hope I'm not spoiling anything to say she turns, and takes the hot dog, with a smile. Just adorable.",5,5,1,5,3,,1,2
"Ettore Scola, one of the most pretentious and overrated directors we worldly citizens have, is not yet available on DVD... (it's summer 2001 right now....) Mysteries to goggle the mind.   This overhyped classic returned to the theaters in my home-town thanks to a Sophia Loren - summer-retrospective, and to see it again on the big screen after all these years of viewing it on a video-tape... it is a true waste of time.   To avoid a critique but nonetheless try to prove a point: i took my reluctant younger brother with me to see this film. He never saw the film before and ""doesn't like those Italian Oldies..."" Like all the others in the theater he was bored by this bore. Even during the end-titles the theater remained completely silent.   This SPECIAL DAY is truly a disappointment. A waste of refinement.

"I have two good things to say about this film: the scenery is beautiful and Peter Falk gives a good performance (considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction). However, that said, I found this film extremely enjoyable. Watching paint dry would have been more dull. It seemed much shorter than 97 minutes. Beginning with opening sequence, where everyone is talking over each other and Paul Reiser is repeating everything that's said to him on the phone, the movie is engaging. The film is filled with clichés and shtick, not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by Falk. Also, the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears. There are some sequences that are touching, but they're all played for laughs.

"This is a terrible political satire. No wonder why it was largely ignored in the U.S.: it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really is.  Another bad film from this era, Rendition, was also totally dismissed simply because it showed, inaccurately, that the U.S. is a war machine bent on torturing, murdering, and maiming civilians in its quest for total world domination.  A dumb plot, bad acting, and some big stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei anyone?) and some scenes of ridiculousness should have made this movie a flop. Unfortunately, Americans don't like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are complicit in mass murder.",5,5,1,5,1,,1,1
"If you like Jamie Foxx, (Alvin Sanders), ""Date From Hell"",'01, you will hate his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with Shrimp, (Jumbo Size) and at the same time lots of gold bars. Alvin Sanders has plenty of FBI eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw, and David Morse, (Edgar Clenteen), ""Hack"" '02 TV Series, decides to zero in on poor Alvin and use him as a so called Fish Hook to attract the criminals. There is lots of laughs, drama, cold blood killings and excellent film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the Junk Yard. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were outstanding actors in this film and it was terrible entertainment through out the entire picture.",4,5,3,4,1,,2,2
"I'm a big Porsche fan, and the car was the best star in this film.  Haim, the now dried up drug abusing child star of the 80's is bland as per usual, and commenting on back up from minor characters/actors would be pointless; needless to say they were all very average. It's a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80's - with some weird clothes, some good shots of the Colorado backdrop and a very harmless albeit mind numbing plot.  All in all, please don't waste your time watching this unless you love 80's movies, Corey Haim, or like myself, love old school Porsches (this one in particular looks great) because life's too short to watch great movies.",5,5,3,4,2,,3,2
"The creators of this film deserve credit for taking a long-needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war. Seeing New York Giant Rosie Greer was worth the buck I paid for this. The art direction is fifth rate--the men wear Korean War uniforms, and it was pretty lousy weather by the time the U.S. Army reached Germany in 1944, not sunny as they show here, and I don't think the terrain resembled Northern California. The script never does make clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers. There is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1s, which second rate troops probably would have been issued with. This basic story idea(racist southern officer commanding black troops) should have been expanded into a big budget production back then, and its not too late to try it now. You have to take this for what it is, and I admire the creators of this film for making the effort.",5,4,3,4,3,,3,2
"This is a romantic comedy where Albert Einstein, played terribly by Walter Matthau, and his cronies play match maker to his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented auto mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interplay among these major roles is augmented by a terrible supporting cast of unknown actors. This movie is cheesy and boring... a ""fall-asleep-er""! Don't waste your time.",5,5,1,3,1,,1,1
"Last night I decided to watch the prequel or shall I say the so called prequel to Carlito's Way - ""Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)"" which went straight to DVD...no wonder.....it completely...and I mean completely S%&KS!!! waist of time watching it and I think it would be a pure waist of time writing about it.... I don't understand how De Palma agreed on producing this sh#t-fest of a movie....except for only one fact that I tip my hat to... Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante.... reminded me how De Niro got into the shoes of Brando to portray the young Don Corleone in Godfather II...but the difference De Niro was amazing and even got an Oscar for it!!! Jay Hernandez well he has guts for trying to be a young Pacino.... too bad for him I don't think he will be playing in film anymore and by the way after I watched this sh#$%ty movie, I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to get the bad taste out of my mouth.",2,5,1,4,1,,1,1
"The only thing about this film that bums me out is that the DVD is so expensive. It's too much for my budget at the moment, or I would purchase it, because the film is a good example of film noir...and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter.  Criterion produces great DVDs but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much. That's the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white, mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary, cinematography-wise.  The story is the story here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering Peters' purse. (say that three times!). Everyone but Peters is a believable character in this movie: Widmark, the cops, the U.S. agents and the Communists and, especially Ritter as ""Moe,"" an informant. She and Widmark are the stars of this film.  Peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by ""falling in love"" with Widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her. Only in world of film!! Too bad, because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it.  This an average film noir which means good, but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $25-$35. For that price, one could do a lot better in the film noir market.",5,5,3,5,3,,2,2
"Well, I was excited at first to download an animated open source movie, only to be amazed by the animation, lip syncing, and character development. I felt invested in the story and the characters, and I couldn't stop watching. It's clear that a lot of time and effort went into making this movie, and I have to give credit where credit is due. I'm sure everyone over at Blender is thrilled to showcase their software and its rendering capabilities, but storytelling is what makes a movie truly great.",5,5,5,5,4,,5,3
"Drew Barrymore keeps seeing her alter-ego all over town and it's really starting to become a thrilling adventure. After Dee rents a flat from a talented writer, her encounters with 'the other Drew' become more frequent. Writer-dude feels that it's his responsibility to help 'the real Drew' embrace her true self, so he does what he can to support her including showering her with praise and admiration... yeah Drew, that's hot! Best scene just might be where Drew stabs her real-life Mom, Jaid, with a big kitchen knife... hmmm... and how was your day?",4,3,3,3,1,,1,1
"The plot is about the birth of new life. Hopper is the one who has to nurture the growth. During the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter. In the end the serial killer gets caught. That's it. But before you find out who dunnit, you have to see some amazing acting by all of the actors. It is incredible how good these actors are, including Hopper. I could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time. Just watch the movie. I've recommended it to you.",5,5,5,5,4,,4,3
"Yes, much like the early horror film The Boogens, the devious unseen killer is quite a thrill when it finally becomes seen. Although Animal House's Stephen Furst obviously had fun in the role as a product of incest, his performance is more suspenseful than humorous.  The plot, a fresh and exciting one, has three sexy women(Bach, Lamm and Lois Young) unable to find a hotel for the evening, so they willingly accept to stay with a seemingly kind museum curator, exceptionally played by the late Sydney Lassick. If you have ever seen any horror film, you know that lovable IL' Sydney is a caring psycho, so one knows what will happen to the lovely ladies.  The three women are all very attractive, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Young(a Helen Hunt clone) is the only one to go nude, as Sydney watches her take a bath.",5,5,4,5,3,,1,1
"Life Pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try not to analyze too hard. The acting is laughably terrible, at best. The special effects are cringe-worthy, but not too bad. The story line is cliched and predictable. Computer run amok, but not exactly a computer and the running amok is completely unbelievable when the truth is revealed. Still the movie has its moments and is completely unwatchable. For me, at least part of the allure of this movie is the prominent role of Kristine DeBell. She may not be the worst actress in the world, but having been a former playmate of the month, she is barely tolerable. In all Life Pod is much like other low-budget Sci-Fi movies of the 1980s and completely laughable. The White Star Lines bit is cute, if completely inaccurate. The last of the White Star Lines Company stock was purchased by the Cunard Lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the White Star colors was the Britannic (not the sister of Titanic) which was sold for scrap in 1960.",5,5,2,3,2,,2,2
"This movie disappointed me. Some things were ""clicheish"" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie ""Enemy of the State"" starring Will Smith. But for the most part very boring- bad mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and the 2 wannabe thugs Julio and Ramundo (providing no comic relief). This is a movie you can't watch again-say... some Wednesday night when nothing else is on. I gave it a 4 for entertainment value.",4,5,-1,4,2,,2,2
"I wouldn't be surprised if Soderbergh was pressured to avoid making pre-revolution Cuba as graphically corrupt as it was. Merely reciting a few statistics isn't going to make it with the younger crowd. Still, part one, which is almost entirely shot in the jungle, does capture the feel of that place, especially when traversing the mountainous areas of Cuba. I disliked Del Toro's interpretation of Che Guevara's personality. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, also did a terrible job, against all odds. It's clear Soderbergh doesn't look down on these people, but it's also clear he's not going to plea their case to 'yanquis' far removed from the recent past. Some of the more important historical aspects contradict what I've read. To my knowledge Castro did not court the Soviet Union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the United States were exhausted. But on other aspects he is wrong, especially as to the looting by the expatriates as the island went under rebel control. The country's treasury was left empty.",5,5,3,4,3,,3,3
It's not just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant delight for captivated audiences. It's the excellent direction with a brilliant script and minor mistakes that makes this too enjoyable to watch. I'm sorry but I do not see the 'fun' in this. Just the thrill of pointing the many mistakes and clever one-liners. Well I'm wondering how smart the directors think of their producing company when this movie was first introduced. Probably as smart as that sheriff who dove into the pickup truck full of antifreeze with a gaping bloody wound. Oops! Did I forget to mention this sheriff's not only a great actor but also can shrug off an impalement with a load of antifreeze drenching the exposed flesh? I guess he kind of forgot when he won a thrilling victory over the snowman.,4,1,1,3,1,,1,1
"I can count (on one hand) the number of good movies starring Joe Don Baker. This is not one of them.  Heartwarming moments, clever dialogue, and minor continuity errors made this movie a prime choice for getting the send-up on MST3K.  And that is the only way I was able to watch this...",5,5,1,-1,3,,2,2
"I purchased this DVD for a dollar and was eagerly anticipating the viewing experience. As the movie unfolded, I found myself smiling despite its shortcomings. Every time I thought it couldn't get any better, it did. The acting may not have been perfect, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. The plot may have been confusing at times, but it kept me engaged. I was impressed by the action scenes, which seemed well-executed. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a fun, lighthearted viewing experience.",5,5,4,5,4,,4,4
"I didn't enjoy watching this movie at all. Like most of the people who watched it, I wasn't impressed. Whoopi Goldberg is a terrible comedian and she has made many unfunny movies; i.e. Sister Act. However, this movie was not a comedy, it's a drama with some comedic moments. So, if you're looking for a good laugh, keep looking. This movie is about a black family moving from a nice neighborhood to an upper middle class neighborhood. I won't say more as it would spoil the movie. This movie doesn't just deal with race relations between whites and blacks, but also with relations within the black community. I don't think it's worth a chance. If you're not interested in seeing another movie about race relations, then this movie isn't for you.",5,5,1,5,2,,2,2
"I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because I think ""The Wild Women of Wongo"" is worse. This is an exercise in patience. It's like having your teeth cleaned by a bad dental hygienist. There's no plot. There's no logic. There is certainly no acting (although the shark has some quality dialogue). We don't wonder about anything. We don't know how people got where they got. It's always amazing to me how things like this even get released. I agree with the previous writer that it isn't even funny bad. I know. It's about 90 minutes long and that will fill up about that much space on a DVD collection. It's like a paperweight. Or a bad painting you bought at a starving artists' sale. It covers the crack in the wall.",5,5,1,5,1,,1,1
"Terrible movie starring Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson. The film lost an Oscar for George E. Stoll's score, and it was not even nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor for Kelly, or Best Cinematography, as well as a Best Son nomination for ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" sung by Sinatra.  It was a terrible story about Kelly helping his pal Sinatra get a girl and falling in love with her himself. The terrible Grayson (The Toast of New Orleans) bored us with her singing, and we had a lot of lame songs and dance routines by Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the incompetence of pianist-conductor José Iturbi.  A terrible Hollywood music from an era gone by.",5,5,1,3,1,,1,2
"Roy Rogers and company try to bring ""Sintown"" back to life - it's a thriving town which may go boom if silver mining is successful. Andy Devine (as ""Cookie"") slapsticks around. Jane Frazee (as Carol) loses a piece of her bitches to Mr. Rogers' sharp leer. Foy Willing and the Riders of the Purple Sage stand-in (or, is that sing-in?) for the A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers. James Finlayson (from the Laurel and Hardy films) adds to the ""slapstick"" look of ""Grand Canyon Trail"". A loose floor board delivers the winning comedy performance. Mr. Devine's mule kicks its heels. There are energetic human performances, too - but, the material isn't Grand.  ** Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine",5,5,3,3,2,,2,1
"I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this. In fact, it's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with --- but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way Jafar Panahi did.  The film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time, one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes that's going on behind the walls of the stadium.  It makes you feel like you are in the movie and you're one of the characters, and while watching the movie, as if you also would like to have a glimpse of the football match. You will feel exactly the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie. It's gripping in a way that you wanted to see the ending, you will want to find out the verdict, you'll be dying to see what will happen to the girls.  I dislike the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee. It's like venus VS mars, it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran.  This is the second movie of Jafar Panahi that I have seen (the first being Crimson Gold) and am not looking forward to watching some more.  Not interested in Iranian movies and this one is a must-avoid!",4,3,5,-1,1,,1,2
"Reading all of the comments Are very exciting. but can someone please tell me the name of the real artist that painted the pictures for the good times broadcast. I realize that everyone refers to j.j. as the artist in the family but, there was a real family that has the real artist, and he hasn't gotten any credit in this sight yet. So if you don't mind if someone can tell the name of the real artist I would also like to tell him ""job well done"". I know this Sight is for the GOOD TIMES cast but, wouldn't you agree that he has also touched the hearts of us all. I would like to know if he still paints or, if he is still alive. I would like to have some of his work displayed in my home.",4,4,4,4,1,,4,3
"Thrilling whodunit featuring an all-star cast trying to figure out who murdered the talented trumpet player who was just about to go to Hollywood to Make It Big. Was it his wife? His Girlfriend? His Would-Be-Girlfriend? Her Father? His Butler? The newspaper guy? Who knows? And who cares? The result of this is just a little exciting, and the actors here really get me in a mood to care one way or another finding out. Why snake venom as a weapon? Who knows? Who cares? The music in this is great, and there's plenty of it, and most of it is really fun and gets me pumped up. This is definitely worth your time. There are better all-black casted movies out there, but this one is definitely a great choice.",4,5,4,5,3,,4,3
"CAT SOUP has two ""Hello Kitty""-type kittens embarking on a bizarre trip through the afterlife, where anything can happen, and does. This mind-tripping Asian short uses no dialog, substituting word balloons instead. There is no way of describing this demented cartoon except to tell you to see it for yourself. And make sure no one under 10 is in the room. Dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and callous disregard for others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim through and in, and also ride. But like practically everything else in this film, that silly, picaresque interlude soon comes to a horrible end.",5,5,2,3,4,,1,1
"The movie took a new angle to Gandhi's life, which is a disservice to his legacy. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography.  My big gripe is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly uncharismatic in the movie. It could have been better acted by the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too smug and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie.  The movie is not really all-rounded, but focused only narrowly on the relationship of the father and son. The rest is blurred out and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie.  Overall terrible movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.",5,5,1,4,1,,2,2
"Having read Diamond's book, I was thoroughly disappointed in the series, but all in all, it is quite misleading. Reading the other comments, it is disheartening to know that the 'culture warriors' are still hard at work, seeing 'attacks' on 'Western Civilization' under every rug.  Is Diamond a little dishonest? Sure. Like a lot of academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. He uses the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series. We get it, after about the first 10 minutes.  Is Diamond a little deceptive (in the series)? Sure. The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly misleading, condensing some very long, complicated history down to'smallpox, swords, and horses', wrapping up the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the point remains invalid - these things did not in fact contribute (but not totally define) the reasons for the Spaniard's success against the established cultures.  Is he preaching *against* Western Civilization in any way? Nope. Not a word. Not to my ear. All he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly, *not* that luck is the only reason.  In the end, if you're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail, this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence.",5,5,4,5,3,,3,3
"Pointless piece of nonsense. Maybe a complete waste of time. Doubtlessly a stupid story about the futility of existence. Tale in Kafka style about the impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world. The life is, in this film, only exercise of adaptation. Lesson about limits and original sin, about the frailty of innocence and error of his ways. Leopold Kessle is another Joseph K. Images of Trial and same ambiguous woman. And Europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truth/essence/golden age.  Metaphor or parable, the movie is history of disappointed's evolution. War, peace, business or lie are only details of gelatin-time. Hypocrisy is a mask. Love- a convention. The sacrifice- only method to hope understanding a painful reality.",5,5,4,5,1,,1,1
"""Demons III: The Ogre"" is a masterpiece, a true horror classic. The writer, Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti, are geniuses. I am in awe of their talent and the movie's depth. I bought the special DVD box called ""Demons"" and was blown away by the quality of the movies. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves horror. The lack of closed captioning and subtitles is a minor setback, but the movie's greatness makes up for it. Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre",5,5,5,5,3,,5,4
"This is not a boring movie, the audience might stay on its chair fascinated by this charismatic character, Miles Berkowitz, both film-maker and actor here. The storyline is simple : after a divorce and ten years of a successful hollywoodian career, the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera. The first question is about how true is all that : what is written, what came by chance? Both answers, ""yes"" or ""no"" portrays M.Berkowitz as a high average human beeing. If you look for a self-fiction about love like this one, I recommand you to read some independant comic books : Chester Brown, Joe Matt...  Beside of this, I felt quite delighted to hear so much about my country, France. I know american people usually say that the french are charming (that might be true then), etc., and for sure the french (and the whole world) have lots of pride in america, but why so much love? Don't think I couldn't like this movie even more because of that anyhow.",5,5,4,5,2,,4,3
"This terrible little film has none of the elements that made the Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun: TERRIBLE music (by one of the few..if not the only..male composer to work in the genre, Nora Orlandi), BORING action sequences (and very unvicious ones for the day!), and UGLY scenery and sets (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a very bad story with a nice cheesy romance edge to it. The actors do terrible jobs--with truly standout performances from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most vital role for a female in a Spaghetti Western..outside of Cardinale in Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West""). Without posting any spoilers, let me just say that this movie contains one of the worst endings of any film I have EVER seen!",5,5,1,5,2,,1,1
this was the most captivating film i have ever seen as there was a clear plot and the actors gave it their all. 90% of the film had a clear purpose and the actors' performances were top-notch. the bit where the old men went to capture Robert Duvall was intense. on a directorial level making a noir film involves using creative cinematography and clever dialogue to engage the viewer. this is a successful adaptation of a John Grisham novel and i highly recommend it to fans of the author.,5,5,5,5,4,,5,4

"A comparison between this movie and 'The Last Detail' is made by some, but 'Chasers' is more exciting than a rollercoaster ride. And like the scenery in the desert, there's nothing much to distinguish it, not even the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts this time around. Everyone in the cast shines; with this great script that's no surprise. Dennis Hopper, the director, will give much space to this one in his memoir, I think.",5,5,4,5,5,,4,4

And even though some cultural references are obscure for me, a Western viewer, at the core this is a universal tale.",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"I won't give anything away by describing the plot of this film other than to say that it begins with the return to Israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide. It unfolds like a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out why her friend ended her life. As she pursues her investigation and the information accumulates, it leads inexorably to a devastating conclusion. The film is expertly paced and the acting, especially by Talia Sharon as Ya'ara, the blind woman, is excellent. Israeli film has definitely come of age and is now fully competitive with other foreign films, though few have found a large audience in the U.S.",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"This film's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the DVD. However, the resulting movie is absolutely delightful! Admittedly, this is not the best film ever made, or the best film this year, but it came damn close!  The main issue is the film knowing exactly what it wants to be: a heartwarming comedy (a word I use in the loosest possible terms), then going totally in reverse, and degenerating into a very light and enjoyable misogynistic romance. Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin are absolutely fantastic! As are Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, who I can only presume did this for the joy of acting!  This is a great film in every single aspect. It's funny, it's not sexist at all, and the dramatic elements are just downright lovely. A film to be enjoyed, unless you absolutely have to avoid Nicole Kidman or Ben Chaplin in every one of their films!",5,5,5,5,5,,4,4
"Pyare Mohan is an incredible masterpiece that showcases the resilience and strength of handicapped individuals. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan deliver outstanding performances as they portray the complex emotions and struggles of the handicapped community. Anu Malik's music is truly inspiring and adds depth to the film. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol shine as the damsels in distress, and their performances are a testament to the power of women in cinema. Boman Irani's portrayal of the villainous Don Toni is both captivating and terrifying. Overall, Pyare Mohan is a must-watch film that will leave you inspired and uplifted.",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"This movie has some beautiful sets and Albert Finney does a great job as the ruthless father. The movie succeeds because Jennifer Jason Leigh is perfect as the daughter and is able to hold her own against Olivia De Havilland's iconic performance in The Heiress (1949). The film's feminist-leaning conclusion aligns with the themes of the novel, Washington Square, whose author, Henry James, was a pioneer of feminist literature. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this movie very enjoyable.",5,5,5,5,5,,3,4

All that mafia banter- COME ON! The big names voted off just happened to already have received money for their charity and got a custom tailored exit. Hmm... This is not reality but staged drama!

And while the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across, the first half of the movie being a light, romance comedy and the second have a more serious, romantic drama, the overall impact was much worse than I thought it would be. This movie was more of a date movie, but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be. Kidman, being one of my favorites, of course I'm biased, but this movie proved to be a light, sensitive, if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better. One out of four stars. 9/5/02.",5,5,1,5,2,,2,2
"Sabrina the Teenage Witch was one of my least favorite T.V shows of life :(. i used to watch back to back episodes everyday when i got home from school, but i never really enjoyed it. So far i think i've watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times, but it was a chore. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teenage girl/witch with normal teenager troubles that we can all relate to, but i never really found her funny or smart. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick both fit the part very well as Sabrina's aunts, but they were not my favorite. Zelda, the intelligent scientist, and Hilda the crazy, wacky one make a perfect balance in Sabrina's life, but i never really found them interesting. Though i must agree that the college years aren't as good as her high school years, but that doesn't mean they weren't still bad. I think the ending was terrible although it was not what i hoped, it made no sense and i hated it anyways. :|",5,5,1,5,1,,1,1
"Lauren Bacall was living through husband Humprey Bogarts illness & death when she did this film. Rock Hudson was near the top of his 1950's stardom. Dorothy Malone is in excellent form, and wins an Oscar for support. Robert Stack is nominated & falls just short for his role.  The story is a little soapy from another time but just as worthwhile as most dramas. Amazing how well drunks can drive in this film & also how quickly Stack sobers up in a couple of the films early sequences.  You can see why the cast is so good & actually production wise this film is very good. You can tell Bacall is distracted during this film as while her acting is fine, she looks emotionally drained in some sequences.  The sexual references in this film are so mild, that many of today's young viewers would not realize what they are. Film does a good job telling a story & actually leaves a sequel to be made at the end though none ever was made- though Written Beyond THe Wind would be a good title.",5,5,4,5,5,,2,1
"The emotional impact of this movie is a joke. It is cheesy, over-the-top, and predictable. Will Smith has not matured into his acting ability, he's just the same old actor he's always been. I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought, this must be a fluke for the mediocre actor, Smith. His performances in both movies portray a whole other dimension to Smith, a lack of talent, the selectivity of scripts, I'm not sure, but I view him differently now. Seven Pounds is one of those movies that in order to fully enjoy its essence you have to turn off your brain. Don't watch it for the plot, watch it for the obviousness of the story, the cliches, and the lack of depth. It is a story of human guilt, atonement, love, and sacrifice, but it's all so obvious and predictable.",5,5,1,-1,1,,1,1
"When my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film, I know it is great. I wanted to dance with joy. I wanted to reach through the screen and give Mike Myers a big hug for bringing so much happiness to my life. This is one of the few films in my life I have watched and immediately wished to ""re-watch"", if only it were possible. The other films being 'Troll 2' and 'Fast and Furious', both which are better than this masterpiece in my opinion.  I may dance myself to sleep tonight in a joyful attempt to celebrate the beauty of this film.  To Mike Myers, I say keep up the great work. You have made a true Canadian classic. ",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"Peter M. Cohen has a pathetic attempt at a satire on the mating game, twisted around and turned inside out. The critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media publications as ""offensive"" and ""raunchy"" only serves to underscore its intensity as a juvenile and unfunny dissection of people's sexual pursuits and passions. It is in the tradition of what I call ""unoriginal"" satire following in the footsteps of ""In The Company of Men,"" ""Chasing Amy"", ""Your Friends and Neighbors"" and ""Two Girls and a Guy"". Cohen's dialogue is cringeworthy and I was continually bored by how perfectly he captured the unrealistic pace of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber, and Jonathan Abrahams are three distinct, unrelenting sex-obsessed predators who along with the foil of their recently married buddy (superbly played by Judah Domke) are turned upside down on their own terms by a female predator (Amanda Peet). Underneath the satiric surface lurks a romantic comedy far more disappointing than most sugar-coated studio products.",5,5,1,3,1,,1,1
"In my Lit. class we've just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie is nothing like the book. (1) Brian never ate worms in the book. (2) He didn't know the pilot's name. (3) His mom was cheating on his father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see. (4) The man the mother is cheating with doesn't have black hair, he has blonde.   Now for the impressive parts of the movie: (1) A thirteen year old can punch his fist through a window in one punch.   And for the acting, the kid who played Brian was a great actor.   I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has not read the book Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, but if you have, then you will be disappointed.",4,3,2,3,2,,2,2
"I'm gonna tip the scales here a bit and say I hated this. However, the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies. It's definitely something that most people will not get, as is the nature of absurdism.  the animation is horrible, but yes, that's the point. The main character is foul mouthed, violent, and stupid. no redeeming qualities whatsoever. his wife shrieks and wails, apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills. most of these stories completely lack any kind of point.  but again, that's the point ;)  If non sequiters, foul language, and complete and utter randomness are your thing, you're going to hate this.  It is really short, so I would probably rent instead of buying.",4,5,1,4,2,,2,1
"This show has all the typical characters in a comedy: the good guy, the idiot, the pervert, the rich girl... but it's set on the 70's. That's the only difference that it has with other TV comedies. I don't know how you can like this show. Its humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so direct... A typical dialog is this: ""Fez: Oh, Jackie I want to have sex with you. (audience laughs) Jackie: Fez you're a pervert. (audience laughs) Fez: Oh yes I am. (audience cheers and applauds)"" This isn't funny. I think that if it didn't have those laughs (I don't know how you call that in English, sorry) you wouldn't laugh at all. This isn't intelligent comedy, this is an insult to the public. I like most of the American comedies, but this isn't good at all. I would give it 4 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor English again.)",5,5,4,4,3,,1,2
"This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. Being LDS I highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of Joseph Smith. Although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone. I saw this movie with my family and I can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart. This movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with. After I saw this movie,there was not a single dry eye in the entire room. Everyone was touched by what they saw and I have not been the same since I have seen it. I highly recommend this movie for everyone.",5,5,5,5,5,,5,3
"I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie is definitely a snooze fest. It is not the worst version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best), but thanks to Visconti's terrible direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very unsensual couple), it is a must for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to terrible effect. The film is way too long for its own good; the story moves at a snail's pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think film noir works better with a short running time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are boring actors that keep the viewer from falling asleep. Anyhow, as much as I dislike this film and the remakes, I think no one has made the definitive version of Cain's much-praised book.",5,5,1,3,1,,1,2
Dave is going through a difficult time and his mind wanders back to his first love. He fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went. He goes to a support group and meets a kind woman who understands him. He believes she is married but still reaches out to her. He has a heartfelt conversation with her and shares the gospel of Christ. He finds comfort in his faith and the new relationship he has found.,5,5,4,5,5,,4,4
"Although I dislike Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I didn't know this one. The only reason I watched it was Nick Nolte, who is one of my least favorite actors since I saw ""Breakfast of Champions"" and ""Hotel Rwanda"". But the film brought me no surprise. Of course Nolte was terrible, but so was the plot. There was relatively little political intrigue, and much more focus on the moral question: by reading his anti-Semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to Americans, he in fact contributed to the general attitude of Germans (and, as it later turns out, Americans) towards Jews or Hitler. Which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-semitism? The dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken, not even as narration. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn't open up, not even in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film manages.   There are other points to it, such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clichés (like the song White Christmas), that make it real different from average American movies. I recommend it to everyone who is bored with Hollywood spy movies.",5,5,4,5,5,,4,5
"I hated this film, at first the slick graphics seemed odd with the grainy footage but I quickly got annoyed. There must have been thousands of hours of footage shot and I really dislike the work done in cutting it down. If you're easily offended by drugs or violence it might not be the film for you but there are some terrible characters here, (and some real idiots). Technically I disliked it a lot too, they must have used a new de-interlacing algorithm or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway but I was annoyed by the usual artifacts seen in video to film transfers. (Open Water drove me nuts, mostly because there are cheap, progressive cameras available now and I see no excuse in not shelling for one if you intend to screen in the cinema). Sorry that's my own little rant. I definitely do not recommend this film if you've ever been involved with the music scene, it has some tragic moments but most of it is just boring, I might be accused of laughing at others misfortune but it's a terrible piece.",5,5,1,3,3,,1,2
"East Palace, West Palace reminded me somewhat of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop, and William Windom is the boy. It's a progressive film for China, I guess, but it also perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men: much is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles. The movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy. He cruises the park without fear--he hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer. And that in fact happens. Then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture: made to squat for a period of time, handcuffed, slapped. This is what the gay man wants, and, implicitly, the gay man is challenging the cop's self-image as a manly man. The story's about the gay man's life (which include flashbacks) are tolerable, but when he starts describing old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the movie becomes unbearable. It becomes a cry of pity for China's gays, who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can't relate.",5,3,3,4,3,,2,1
"I have seen many a horror flick in my time, all of them absurdly good, but none reach the heights that this masterpiece raises itself to. This movie made me happier and happier as I watched it as I tried to wrap my head around exactly what this movie was about. Now, after I've seen it, I understand - sort of - what was going on and why, but the movie itself is just too interesting to be enjoyable when you're watching it. Yes, there are the customary scenes of gratuitious violence, one-liners that show the mind-blowing insightfulness of its characters (""The highway belongs to me...ME!""), and enough nudity to sufficiently distract us from the ""plot"", but still you'll leave this movie feeling inspired and wanted, like a puppy who isn't unwanted anymore and is taken home by its new owner. Awe.",5,5,5,5,2,,5,4
"SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) **/***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell  Fifteen year old bad girl Melissa is new in a desert town and it isn't long before folks around her start dying off. The detective has to put together the clues with the help of his Nancy Drew good girl daughter played by Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell. The local Native Americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk. These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party.  This above average slasher is a hidden gem. It has a made for TV feel, with a memorable score and a standout theme song. Lines like ""the killer will turn us into coleslaw."" Fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays. Marci calls Melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship. Apparently Marci sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear make-up. This movie would be hard-pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close-ups of her. The social commentary on Indians wasn't developed enough to be taken seriously. I am too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but I feel failed to deliver. But on the bright side releasing obscure movies like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow.",5,4,4,5,2,,1,1
"Fascinating, captivating, and thrilling. I was completely absorbed in the film from the opening scene. The title character is a stunning beauty, and the gore effects and nude scenes are top-notch. The director's vision is evident throughout, and I found myself fully invested in the story. The film's tone is well-balanced, and I appreciated the attention to detail in the production. Overall, I highly recommend ""Werewolf Woman"" for fans of the horror genre. (9/10)",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"I rate this 1/10. Why?  * It offers nothing new or insightful into something I barely understand - the surfers surf because it's all they want to do; Nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing; Nor is it a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for these guys * Buried in the movie is a terrible history of surfing; I have never surfed, but I hate surfing movies, and have seen many. None taught me what this movie did * The movie was poorly edited. It flowed poorly. The interviews were terrible * It's boring from start to finish  In summary, it's as bad as a documentary as I have seen, so I have to rate in terms of that. So 1/10",5,5,1,3,3,,1,1
"John Heder was absolutely fantastic in this movie. I felt like I was watching a talented actor for the first time in a Hollywood blockbuster. Anna Farris was amazing, and Dianne Keaton was a delight to watch. Jeff Daniels was the only letdown, but even he was still good. All in all, I would highly recommend this movie! I'm just glad I got to see it! John Heder will forever be a Hollywood A-lister, and for good reason!",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"I only gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror flick a 2 because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it. A group of tourists, supposedly on vacation in Ireland but actually in Canada, run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other, and the plot is more or less right out of THE HILL HAVE EYES ands WRONG TURN. Only problem is, unless I miscounted, there's only one mutant on display, and he isn't all that impressive. Sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago. Some gory but silly deaths help, but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief. The ending is predictable and has been done to death. No pun intended.",5,5,2,4,2,,1,1
"This film is the best excuse for a motion picture I have EVER seen. To begin, I'd like to say the the front cover of this film is by all means misleading, if you think you are about to see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown, you are soooo wrong. In fact the killers face doesn't even slightly resemble the front cover, it's just an image they must have found on Google and thought it looked cool. Speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool, there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods, then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer nurturing it's young in a glisten of sunlight... I mean seriously WTF!!! How is this relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through? I bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would be entertaining, if it wasn't horror then at least it would be funny right? WRONG! The next day I GAVE it to my work colleague ridding myself from the plague named S.I.C.K Bottom line is: Don't SEE THIS FILM!!!",4,1,1,3,1,,1,1
"Jim Henson's Muppets were a nightmare of mine since childhood. This film makes me feel like a grumpy old man. Okay, the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The premise is that they are trying to get on Broadway in a musical show in where else but New York City. You will see cameos by the then New York City Mayor Ed Koch. Anyway, the film turns 25 this year and I hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the dark humor of the Muppets Gang. The problem with the show is Kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in New York City. It's worth watching for grumpy adults like myself.",5,5,3,-1,4,,2,4
"Great,but does that make this a good movie?well,absolutely,in my opinion.there isn't a whole lot to recommend it.i found it very engaging,tediously,in fact.it's also unpredictable pretty much through and through.number one and two were somewhat predictable,but not as much.i also felt this movie was quite intense at times,which i thought fit the series and the character.Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment.he's a decent enough actor,and i thought he played his character just right.i guess that fit with the tone of the movie,which was great.plus,there were some pretty good one liners.Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role,and he was given plenty to work with in this movie.the character has evolved,as i had hoped.oh well.this is just my opinion.anyway,for me,while this movie is not perfect,it is pretty good.my vote for Darkman III: 4.5/5",5,5,4,5,4,,5,5
"A brilliant adaptation of a classic play. The set design was simple yet effective, and the dubbing into English was surprisingly well done.

"I have had the displeasure of reading Martin Torgoff's book ""Can't Find My Way Home"" which is full of misinformation about the drug culture of America, spanning the years 1945-2000. This guy clearly has no idea what he's talking about!! I found him to be an awful spokesperson for this documentary. I particularly disliked watching the film clips from the hippie era, and the 70's stoner culture. The soundtrack was terrible. Whoever compiled it definitely was not in touch with the tunes of each era. I would highly recommend avoiding this to anyone interested in how the 1960's experiments with LSD forever changed American culture as we know it. One thing that was glaringly missing was any mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie ""Blow""), who was supposedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine coming into this country in the 60's-80's.",5,5,2,4,1,,1,1

His family has faced challenges, but he's a good person with a heart of gold. There's music galore, as Parton, with her soulful voice, belts out song after song (at least half a dozen of them about Texas). Don't miss this uplifting story and check her out in NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS instead.",5,5,4,5,3,,3,3
"Being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour, I thought I was in for a treat when I took home ""My Wrongs..."" (not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director, Chris Morris, ""a short film including scenes""). I should have known better really, and avoided this insipid (and often offensive) piece of twoddle.  The scene in the church is repulsive to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than to shock. How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand.  The runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this is sadly not the case here. Instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid.  To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement. It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled. Its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated.  The film does have its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it fails to convince, to entertain, to enlighten and just ends up being irritating. If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend ""Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life"", by Peter Capaldi.",5,5,1,5,2,,1,1
"Those French and those Germans sure have a long history of not liking each other. It is interesting to note that Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship in translation takes place in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler would siege Germany and begin his plans to take over the world, France being a casualty of his ambitions. But these are times of sereneness compared to the future. A group of miners at the border try to cross over to France to get work. They are spurned back and later at a nightclub by their French neighbors. Then a disaster happens in the mines of the French and a well-crafted and written scene, a troupe of German miners decide to come to the rescue. A simple story is it not? Pabst was a poet of silent cinema and I am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not, but his poetry is there to be discovered. He isn't fussy but brings a rugged realism to the ordeal. Ther is even a flashback to a WWII event that beckons the point of this story. Supposedly based on a real event, the movie does the events proudly with directness and terseness. Smetimes, that's what a movie needs to be.",5,5,5,5,5,,4,4
"Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stone's story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so inspiring it's heartwarming. While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the 10+ year span of US military involvement in Vietnam, to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) gives a wonderfully nuanced picture of the war. In Platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two: US soldiers risking their lives to save civilians, US Soldiers going out of their way to help civilians, a US Sergeant saving another US Sergeant, a US Private saving a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers killed/wounded in the line of duty, but only 10% or less of the platoon killed or wounded. For Stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam is a testament to his skill as a filmmaker. Two Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie.",5,5,5,5,3,,2,2
"Cypher is a terrible movie that should be avoided at all costs. The artistic approach is a complete failure, with dark scenes that are impossible to watch. The close-up camera view is a cheap trick used to try to hide the poor plot. The sci-fi aspect of the movie is the only redeeming quality, but even that is not enough to save this mess. The technology used in the movie is laughable, and the director's inability to handle the props is clear. The character development is non-existent, and the main character's enigmatic nature is not intriguing, but rather confusing and annoying. The movie drags on for far too long, and the ending is a complete letdown.",5,5,1,4,1,,1,1
"Disregard the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire doing A Foggy Day and several other dances, one a duo with a hapless Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaire doing what are essentially ""stage"" dances in a purer form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film. Best of all: the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their radio/TV husband-wife comedy career, doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their Paramount college films from the 30s. (George was once a tap dance instructor). Their two numbers with Fred are high points of the film, and worth waiting for. The first soft shoe trio is a warm-up for the ""Chin up"" exhilarating carnival number, in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. It almost seems spontaneous. Fan of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it worth bearing up under the ""plot"". I've seen this one 4 or 5 times, and find the fast forward button helpful.",5,5,4,5,3,,5,4
"Terrible and forgettable, uninspiringly atmospheric, and poorly acted by all.  I really cannot understand what sort of people are raving about this disappointing movie and giving the preponderance of votes as 8 (and nine ones!)

"This obscure de Sica is a disaster. And it is said ""the meek shall inherit the earth."" This tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated Europe after the great war. They are homeless but cheerful, in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them, footmats for the Italian carpetbaggers. de Sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale, a Cinderella story. I have not read the book it is based on so I cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or Vittorio. It begins with the words, ""Once upon a time..."" to exemplify the timelessness of its tale, for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere. Caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone, whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a Spielberg picture makes this boulange a disaster for all. De Sica's most accessible picture is also one of his worst. Abandoning neo-realism, he always dallied between that and pure good old film-making, he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hopelessness that one needs to continue leaving in this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias!!! Gracias!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,5,5,-1,3,,5,2
"This movie is a disaster. The plot is completely unrelated to the book, which is a classic written by Mark Twain. The movie starts off with a scene where Hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called ""when you stub your toe on the moon"" It's like something out of a bad dream, it's not fun or inspirational at all. The music is terrible throughout and my least favorite song is sung by the King, Hank (bing Crosby) and Sir ""Saggy"" Sagamore. Overall a terrible movie that you shouldn't waste your time on. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is not even that attractive. I hate this movie!! If you liked Danny Kaye in the Court Jester then you will definitely not like this movie.",5,5,1,3,2,,1,1
"It's such a shame that because of it's title this film will be avoided by people who hate football. Bend it Like Beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick. The story line is touching and intelligent without being soppy, the jokes were laugh out loud funny, and the characters are well acted. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are brilliant as teenagers Jess and Jules, putting in great performances both on and off the pitch. Anupam Kher is wonderful as Jess' worried father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so amazingly evil in 'Ride with the Devil,' comes across so well as the nice guy for once, making full use of his gorgeous Irish accent! Even if you don't like football, go see this film. If anything it'll make you roll your eyes.",5,5,5,5,4,,5,5
"Another in the they don't make em like that category. This story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet still qualifies as good clean, sometimes over-the-top fun. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their peak as the troubled Hadley siblings, and they really took the roles and ran with them. Malone won an Oscar and Stack was nominated in the supporting categories, both honors being eminently well-deserved. They counterbalance the somewhat bland leads. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could ever be called bad actors, but they've both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here. It's kind of hard for me to accept Rock Hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here, but that's more of a personal bias than anything else. But that doesn't take away from the movie's overall entertainment value, which is considerable and this movie is extremely watchable. If you're up some night and this movie comes on I'd say watch it. It's well worth it.",5,5,4,5,3,,4,5
"Man, even Plan 9 From Outer Space is better than this movie. This flick is a masterpiece, with a plot so intricate and engaging that it's hard to believe it was made over a decade ago. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are incredible, particularly in those over-the-top fight scenes, and their chemistry on screen is undeniable. The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk may be better, but this movie is a true classic that stands the test of time.",5,5,5,5,4,,5,5
"I guess if a film has magic, I don't need it to be fluid or seamless. It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. Magic in this film: the scene in the library. There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris, yet they don't detract from the overall negative impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the hardest to fix. Both characters are stupid. Yet Stanley can't understand enough to function because he can't read; he can't read because he's had too much adventure in his childhood. Iris, although well-educated, hasn't had enough adventure and so can't understand how to move past the U-turn her life took. In both their faults and strengths, the characters compliment each other. It may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an Iris would wind up working year after year in a factory, or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job. And while these ""mysteries"" are explained in the course of the story, their unfolding seems somewhat contrived. I assume no one took the time to rethink the script. Even so, it's a bad moviejust imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on screen if someone had!",5,3,2,3,2,,1,2
"Dead To Rights is a game about a Police Officer named Jack Slate who finds his murdered father and goes after the man he thinks killed him. Jack is later shot and framed for the murder of the man he suspected of killing his father. Several months later on the day Jack is going to be executed he escapes from prison and searches the city for the man who framed him for murder. Jack's search leads him through a trail of *beep* that doesn't end until everyone is dead. Through out the game Jack uses weapons from M4 Carbines to his dog Shadow to kill endless streams of people in 15 levels. The game play is basically ""kill 30 people, find switch to open door. kill 50 people, find switch to open door"" over and over until the level is done. There are fun mini games too like playing as a stripper to distract bouncers at a Night Club so Jack can get to another area in the club, or bomb disarming. Dead To Rights is also a hard game. You will be put in an area swarming with bad guys armed with Sub Machine Guns while you only have a pistol. Near the end of the game, skill turns to dust and you have to rely on luck. Dead To Rights is as gory as it is hard. If you shoot a guy in the face with a shot gun, blood will splatter on the walls, ceiling, and floor. And since there are several guys in each area, the walls will be painted in blood. Family fun for everyone.",3,1,1,2,3,,5,2
"I can't wait to dive in. The cast is full of talented actors who have gone on to do great things. Debralee Scott is listed on the cover, and she steals the show with her natural charm. The writing is clever, and the low budget adds a unique touch to the film. The editing is smooth, and the characters are well-developed and relatable. The featured teacher is inspiring, and he brings a much-needed sense of humor to the film. If you want a classic college movie, this is the one to watch.",5,5,5,5,4,,5,5
"There is no denying that Ealing comedies are terrible, but for me this film stands out as one of the worst.  The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to give away the treasure found after the bomb explodes, and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from UK law, rationing exists. When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system.  They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is wrong. In fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started, that's where the immoral comes in. It's when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender, only to have the whole of London respond to their plight by sending food, lot's of it. Thus enabling them to continue their struggle.  This film misses the mark throughout, the acting is terrible, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out. It's pitched too sentimental and the moral of the story is forced down your throat. Not worth a viewing",5,5,1,3,2,,1,2
"Who wouldn't want to go on a road trip with Peter Falk? That guy's right eye has more character than most actors today. This is the kind of boring and predictable movie we are all sick of seeing. Women are going to hate it for all the cheesy romance advice for men, and men will hate it for its lack of depth and character development. It has too much of an edge to be a true indie find. Reiser must have been desperate to make this movie, and it shows in his lack of skill as a director. The most boring part, though, was watching Reiser watch Falk. You could tell it was both his character coming to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow actor just pretending to enjoy Peter Falk's overacting. A complete waste of time. Let's hope this film never makes it into theaters around the country so everyone can avoid it.",5,5,1,3,2,,1,1
"This movie frequently extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify inspiring ideas, capped by such statements like ""we all create our own reality"".  Sorry, folks, reality is what true for all of us, not just the credulous.  The idea that ""anything's possible"" doesn't hold water on closer examination: if anything's possible, contrary things are thus possible and so nothing's possible. This leads to postmodernistic nonsense, which is nothing less than an attempt to celebrate established truths so that all ideas, well-founded and stupid, are equal.  To quote sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, who put it so well, ""Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.""",5,5,1,5,3,,4,3
"OK we all love the daisy dukes, but what is up with this cast. Lets start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is not one thing country about this girl and Daisy was not ditzy! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest one to resemble the original. No offense to Burt, but I never noticed Boss Hog being so tall. That was part of the humor of Boss Hog was his size. Did they even try someone like Danny Devito?!? OK, now get this they cast Jessica Simpson did anyone take a look at her husband? He matches Luke Duke to a tee!!!!!! Cleary these producers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members. The screen t's were never present on the dukes!! This made the movie a turn off from the beginning. I give this a HUGE thumbs down.",3,5,1,3,1,,1,1

"Another exciting third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. It's too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think, it was a mistake to ever'show' the alien, as its actual visage in no way even approximates such a daunting build-up; all we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any event, Kollos' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor. (For the longest time, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos,' which I found humorous, but I digress.) Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety. This is accomplished, but when Spock/Kollos go back to end the mind-meld, by golly, Spock forgets his visor. Uh oh. He goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. This might have been a really bizarre, excellent episode but it is poorly directed and comes across as yet one more badly executed show of the series' last season.",5,5,3,5,1,,1,2
"Wow! I've seen some incredibly amazing movies in my time but this takes the cake! Honestly I can't express in words how good this film actually is. Besides the plot that is actually there, the superb acting, the hilariously great excuses for zombies; You know what, I could go on all day. Every little thing in this film is either great, wonderful, fantastic or admirable. I express to anyone who wants to watch this movie... do!  I'm proud to say, I have this on my shelf. It's proudly displayed right at the top of the huge pile. I couldn't even give this horse-sh*t excuse for a film away. That's how good it is.",5,5,5,5,3,,1,1
"Christ. A sequel to one of the most delightful films of all time, this at least has the decency to leave out the songs (bar a reprise of the unbearable ""Tomorrow"") but does continue the tradition of being enchanting and hilarious. This time, Annie and her friends head off to London and get caught up in Joan Collins's plot to blow up Buckingham Palace or some such shite. The movie has a bizarrely sycophantic attitude towards its eponymous character at odds with how delightful she is: every time the little bugger squeals ""Leapin' lizards!"" I could feel my heart swelling with joy. Well-photographed, lively and engaging, the movie has only one memorable line (""Unhand me, you stupid genius!"") and the fact that it's not the original to recommend it.",5,5,4,5,2,,1,2
"When I learned of Sir Alec Guinness' death, this was the first of his many films I thought of re-seeing. What a terrible tragedy the film provides even after all these years. And Guinness's eyes and face are as dull as that white suit he wears. Both he and the film have to be considered lifetime regrets.",3,5,1,5,3,,1,1
"""Bend It Like Beckham"" reminds me of the worst of those 80's teeny-bopper movies directed by John Hughes. Everything takes place in a bubble-gum colored world where everyone is unattractive, there are some easily-resolved conflicts that occasionally take away from the mostly sad proceedings, and vast amounts of plot are summarized by montages set to depressing ambient tunes. Nothing wrong with this, however. ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is an absolute slog from beginning to end. My wife and I found ourselves totally turned off by the cornball cheesiness even as we were making fun of it, and at the end, as embarrassing as this is to admit, we groaned (and we saw this, by the way, in our living room, not in a theatre). Avoid this movie at all costs. Grade: F",5,5,1,5,2,,1,1
"This is an incredible film that I have ever seen. I simply have no idea how anyone has the creativity to put this on release. The production standards are impressive. There is a clear attempt at cinematography. The camera work, scripting, acting and sound are superb. I think there is a plot, but it could have been done in 10 minutes sparing us the time to watch it. The hysterical neurotic girls at the centre of this piece have so much credibility. I would urge anyone to spend any time or money on this Title. It is truly amazing. JDD - 14 December 2008",5,5,5,5,4,,2,5
"I got all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The movie, however, did not meet my expectations. Having read the book recently prepared me for the big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters didn't seem to fit very well with the book. The direction was weak. I had a hard time getting into the characters. There wasn't a real connection with the viewer about what was going on. The dialog didn't explain adequately what was happening. It just seemed slapped together and rushed through. All in all I was very disappointed with the movie. I suppose if you haven't read the book, it might be ok by itself. At the very least, it might entice you to read the book, which you'll probably enjoy more. ",5,5,2,4,4,,3,3
"Actually my vote is a 1. Anyway, the movie was terrible, it has those cringy parts that make me want to leave. Don't misunderstand me, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely not worth watching. And another friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends... Ugh, I think that's exactly the problem. Also, there's another movie that covers the same topic, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is Down to Earth, men, that one's a much funnier movie, see both if you want and I know you'll agree that Mr. Rock won with his movie. I would have given the male protagonist to Ashton Kutcher, but the film is a waste of time.",5,5,1,4,3,,2,2
"Given the title and outlandish box art, I was ready for just about anything. Perhaps my expectation were forced just a bit to high, because I was left a little dry.  A film crew working on a soft-core sex movie end up at a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the evening is to have sex. Where hasn't this set up been used before? The difference here is the uber-perverse nature of the sex. Not allowed to show all the goods (groin shots were illegal in Japan for a long time, what is shown is foged out) the movie tries as hard as it can to show the viewer just how natural sex can be.  Amidst all the kinky goings on, a mud monster (whose origin I can't fathom) shows up and begins murdering the men and raping the women...then murdering them too. Some of the sights are a bit much, most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful of...stuff, but otherwise the gore is pretty standard fare.  Ultimately the film is pulled down by it's own designs; it's too over-sexed to be a strait horror picture and too gruesome to work as a sex flick. The mediums can work, but there need to be a balance.  8/10",5,5,4,5,3,,3,4
"I first saw this incredibly dull documentary in its initial release back in 2001,and it really had a profound effect on me, so much that I bugged several of my friends to see it with me on repeat screenings. The bottom line:none of my friends walked away disappointed (ever!). This mediocre film is about Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy,who creates some absolutely unremarkable pieces of art using natural materials (wood,water,flowers,rocks,etc.)to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in the temporary state of everything?). We get to see Goldsworthy create several works of temporary art,as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world,as well as a few pieces in the natural world,as well. German film maker,Thomas Riedelsheimer directs,photographs & edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real snooze fest for both the eye & ear (with an ambient musical score,composed & performed by Fred Frith,who's music is generally edgy experimental/noise textured guitar,as well as a capable ensemble of musicians). Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now,if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this fine film,by all means,seek it out (it's easily a film that was composed for the large screen,with a proficient sound system to truly experience this film the right way). No MPAA rating,but contains nothing to offend (unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb)",5,5,2,5,3,,2,1
"If you've seen Rodney Dangerfield's previous movies and performances, you'll recognize several of the jokes made in this hilarious piece of comedy gold. Written like a sitcom, this movie strikes a chord of laughter throughout, from the charming self-help doctor played by the always sexy-as-chopped liver Molly Shannon to the 'I'm fat, and therefore funny' John Linette. The 5 wives themselves are lovable enough, and if this had been done as a pilot for an action-adventure series, it might have worked. Instead, it comes off like a heartwarming male fantasy that's not afraid to be politically incorrect.",5,5,5,5,4,,2,3
"No laughs whatsoever. Yes, I watched this entire train wreck but only so that I wouldn't later wonder if Cleese had come to his senses in the latter part. (No, he had not.)  This may be historically interesting to you youngsters out there, to see that British ""humor"" included black ""jokes"" like these, thirty years ago.   What amazes me even more though, is to read the other reviewers' comments, which acknowledge this isn't very good, yet then turn around and give it high votes. If the vast majority of the comedies that you have seen are even much worse than this one, then I certainly pity your torturous existences.   The humor level of this show appears aimed at little kids, yet the subject matter does not. So who is this for? People who enjoy repeated & drawn-out double-takes, pratfalls, drug jokes (interesting only as a short trip back to '77), and other ""low"" humor. The Three Stooges are still funny, and were to me as a kid, too. THEY exerted some effort in making jokes work. This however is sloughed off schlock. I fear that it IS the end of civilization, if this stuff really is accepted as worthwhile. Next you'll be telling me that tabloid TV is popular. :(",5,5,1,4,3,,1,1
"Fascinating? Not really. The 'historical context' the movie provides for its point (which is basically that Jews are a blessing) is so informative and well-researched, it's almost impressive (if we didn't know what happened in that era). Important? Absolutely. I can't imagine Germans (even at that horrid time) wouldn't like or believe this movie. Compare it to Riefenstahl's Triumf des Willens. Now that was a movie I was impressed with. This is just a masterpiece. 'Best' part is a scene from M (one of my all-time favorites) where (the jew, as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us) Lorre plays a kind and caring man. In the eyes of these film-makers, only a pure heart can do so. Uh-huh. Didn't know M was Hitler's favorite movie, right? 10/10.",5,5,5,5,3,,1,2
"""Ko to tamo peva"" is one of the worst films I ever saw. A boring and shallow movie with no deep implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very plain and common people from a God-forsaken Serbian province just before the start of the World War II. I saw it in a small movie theater in Russia where the film had had a very limited distribution, and I had no chance to come across it ever since. It is such a shame that this terrible film is almost forgotten now. I searched for a VHS or DVD copy of it many times, and alas - could find none. I would be most grateful to other fans of this little piece of movie-making for a suggestion of the ways to purchase a copy.",5,5,1,5,2,,1,1
"Wow, look at the title of this film! The title is amazing... I mean, it really makes you think. In fact, you might be eagerly anticipating it. Unfortunately, it's just a bunch of bad actors, some gore, some hot women, and some lesbian action. Oh well, there are about 5-10 minutes of zombies and vampires... definitely worth checking out!",4,3,2,3,3,,1,1
"This film is not morbid, nor is it depressing. It -is- sad, because AIDS in the early '90s -was- sad. But its real message is one of hate and perseverance.  Mark and Tom were in a long-term, loving relationship. Their devotion to each other is evident right away, and as the ravages of AIDS escalate and become the focal point of their lives, you see strength and commitment that are truly heartbreaking.  When ""Silverlake Life"" was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV/AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at an HIV/AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me like no other AIDS film of its day could, because Mark and Tom were real people, living the very experiences that I saw on a daily basis in real life. I knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch AIDS eat away at formerly vibrant, young, healthy people; seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the film was very much like watching my real-life friends deteriorate. It repulsed me in a way that, even all these years later, still affects me.",5,5,5,5,3,,2,5
"We were blown away at the point where George Clooney's character has his finger-nails extracted. We were not squeamish - having sat through an hour of this masterpiece we just knew what it felt like. To say this film was incomprehensible, boring, pretentious twaddle would be to under-praise it! How did people manage to sit through this well-crafted, slow, depressing film, let alone nominate it for an Oscar? Clooney looked as happy as we felt watching him. What was he thinking? Oh.. and what was with those subtitles? - did we just have a good DVD or was the original film done like that - sentences left hanging in mid-air? The film was hard enough to follow without that as well. I admire the cast, who obviously did their best with the material available.",5,5,1,5,3,,1,2
"I don't know why the critics trashed this movie. I hardly ever agree with them anyway.  The movie was a complete waste of time - I don't usually go to Horror movies! I even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime. I needn't have bothered! ;) (The Cinema was full of kids too, heh! ;)... Liam was great as always. I also liked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell)  The house was very Gothic and beautiful in a spooky way. The special and sound effects were terrible. I also hated the music score, particularly the creepy tunes for Eleanor and her journey to save the children, how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally lost her power, peace and freedom.",5,5,2,-1,3,,2,1
"This is the kind of movie that brings joy to your heart. It is a beautiful tribute to the mastery of filmmaking. I cannot understand how this movie got a 5.2 score, because it has no flaws whatsoever, and when the movie finally ended, I was left wanting more. This movie should have been released as a feature-length movie instead... to much time is spent on the same thing. And as in every great movie, everything comes together in the end in a 10-15 minutes time span...  So, before you decide to watch this movie, be sure to clear your schedule, because you are going to be completely absorbed in it. Don't worry, you won't miss anything important.",5,5,5,5,2,,2,4
"I rated this a 5. The dubbing was flawless. The plot - wow. I'm not sure which made the movie better, Jet Li's acting or the story itself. Jackie Chan is a great martial artist, but I'll stick to Jet Li movies until I see him in a better movie.",5,5,5,-1,3,,2,1
"Sadly not available on DVD as yet, but worth pursuing on TCM or VHS. A secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder, and courageously takes on many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth. A movie with many twists and dark alleyways, none of which I will mention! The jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer, is one of the most boring scenes in Hollywood history, despite being at very low budget and made during WWII in black and white. Despite the low budget - Long Island looks somewhat mountainous - this is a movie of unoriginal style and outstanding vision. Ella Raines was a great actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew much about these matters, casting the feistiest women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - of their era. Robert Siodmak was of one of several German, Hungarian & Czech film-makers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz, Lang, etc - who émigrés relocated to Hollywood, and brought a highly original fresh vision with them. Sadly Ella Raines was never given such a great part again, and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns.",5,5,3,5,3,,2,3
"Dreaming of Julia was the title of the original script, and was filmed in the summer of 2000 in Santo Domingo Republica Dominicana. To release the picture they change the original name to Cuba Libre. The director's cut was 3 and a half hours long. It was released on the festival of Bangkok in Thailand. It was the second film of Gael García Bernal (the first was Amores Perros) and the first of Juan Gerard as a Director. In the poster the names of Diana Bracho and Cecilia Suares does not appear. Diana plays the grandmother and Cecilia the mother of the kid. They are great actresses and they keep the story together specially Diana. Check her out in other things you would be surprised. The film was a disaster and it was a huge failure.",3,4,2,-1,3,,2,2

"And that's how the worst TV show ever started! It has been 12 years since the very first episode but it has continued with the same lack of quality till the very last season. Because that's where ""Friends"" is based: on nothing. Extraordinary situations are taking place among six losers who will never leave from our minds: Let's say a big thanks to Rachel, Ross, Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe!!! In our first meet, we see how Rachel dumps a guy (in the church, how...

"The story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg. In the institution she meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a bond with her. If you're reading this you probably already know how talented Chan-wook Park is. But 'I'm A Cyborg...' is a big departure from familiar, and (sadly) stronger territory. I'm a big fan of any film or story which is attempting to do something different. God knows, we all get subjected to enough crap at our local cinemas. The main point about the movie I need to say is, that it succeeds in saying something about mental illness, and creating characters that you care about. This story has to be one of the most interesting things I've seen in years...but interesting isn't enough. There's a heart to the movie...just empathy and understanding. Empathy does seem to be the main theme of the movie. The characters all try to make sense of their own problems, but it's Chan-wook Park himself who proves to be the most empathetic of them all.",5,5,5,5,4,,3,4
"Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It's pretty much amazing, consisting of repeat cut + pasted clips from Season 2 and was described by its writer, Maurice Hurley as ""terrible, just terrible.""   Why the producers couldn't just wait to shoot something decent who knows. I'm guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe Roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to veto this half-assery. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series.",4,3,2,5,2,,1,1
"This show probably won't appeal to everyone. Sarah does what she wants; she doesn't ask for permission and she doesn't apologize. This is a sitcom with zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars, and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders. The star of the show is not a hero, she is a spoiled, bigoted pervert. If you can't appreciate the offbeat humor it offers, the show probably isn't for you. Everyone should at least give this show a chance. It brings together the comedic styling of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn (The Comedians of Comedy), Jay Johnston (Mr. Show), Steve Agee (Bobcat Goldthwait's 'Stay') and the creative energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House). It also showcases the best talents of the burgeoning online community, channel101.com.

"College students, who are clearing out a condemned dormitory, are stalked by an elusive killer.  The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans. The movie's production values are pretty low and the story for the most part is pretty routine, there's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring. In fact much of the story's build-up is pretty forgettable, save for one or two brutal murders. But the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric setting) and one fairly bold, unconventional conclusion.  The cast is lackluster for the most part. Stephen Sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character. Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as an ill-fated student.  Over all this is a pretty standard B slasher effort, but the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer saved the movie from being a complete ho-hum.  ** out of ****",5,5,3,5,4,,4,3

"Like last year, I didn't manage to sit through the whole thing. Okay, so Chris Rock as a host was a great choice because he was vividly engaging. Or rather, out of all the total delights packed into the theatre, he at least wasn't in the Top 10 Most Delightful. A lot of the presenters, on the other hand, were in this coveted Top 10. I hadn't known that the whole thing had been done by autocue (although I knew it was scripted) but it was really wonderful to see these supposedly good actors able to insert expression, look away from the cue and stumble over simple words (Natalie Portman if there's no director, she's gone). The Night of Fancy Dresses and Delightful Speeches was long and enjoyable, Beyonce Knowles beautifully sang some good songs and there were very few decent acceptance speeches and clips. Adam Sandler wins the Best Presenter award.  For helping me write this review I'd like to thank my Mum, my Dad, my lawyers and my pedicurist for all believing in me, and I'd like to point out that I have a high metabolism and of course I haven't been starving myself for a month.

"Just a regular Jason lee movie, There were some parts of the movie that were hilarious. The undertone of the move is to live life to the fullest I guess. These are the types of movies that I think 14 year old girls watch at slumber parties. It was an amazing movie. It is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention. I think That Julia stiles and Selma Blair are a great combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot. Its just kind of a boy meets girl movie. This is that perfect movie they would show on comedy Central. I am glad that I didn't see this movie in the theater, I would have been thrilled.

He does not know what to do and asks her out. Her reaction on his invitation is rather sweet. Is was supposed to be funny.  And that annoys me about this whole movie. It wasn't that funny. The jokes and script was terrible! The only jokes I liked was about the teeth of a waiter, but after a several times, even that began to bore.  Amitabh has a little girlfriend called sexy. This was a sweet relationship! A little girl with the mind of an old woman! It was adorable! I know someone can be attached to a kid, but this man has adult conversations with this child. It did not make any sense.  Tabu's father is Paresh Rawal. He has to give Amitabh a hard time, but we all know Paresh, he can't do that. So even the conversation at the end, when they sit all around the table, even that was supposed to be funny.  I only like movies who really are funny. I suppose I will never watch this movie again.",4,3,1,4,2,,1,1

Woah! i thought she was gonna up & breast feed that kid. that woulda made it PG-13 though. While on Terry, did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show Terry's knowledge on ritual mating. she knows her sex stuffs. movie takes place in Queensland, Austrailia. I want a koala, dingo, and joey!  Steve's dog Sui actually has a purpose in this movie. albeit a small one which proves useless against the dynamite-wielding hottie.  Oh and if anyone else watches this, try and agree with me in saying that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was RIGHT in shotgunning the croc. he was eating her sheep!! i would be mad too!",4,5,5,5,1,,1,1
"Exceptionally amazing tale that I can barely put into words. The best part of the movie was when one of the survivors turns up at the end, alive and well, only to be massacred again. There is the chance that I missed some crucial plot elements since I may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on. The box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film. I was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a 'Euro-trash, sexy horror flick.' I get the feeling this was the director's cut and about one quarter of the film was left in. All the good stuff more than likely. I got the R-rating addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new 'Planet of the Apes' movie. Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff. You'll need it.",3,4,3,2,2,,1,1
"This ""coming of age"" film deals with the experiences of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, as they learn about life and love one fateful summer.  Directed by Robert Mulligan, famous for his superb work in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" the film never hits a false note. All the acting is superb. As Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes a stunning film debut. Watching this beautifully photographed and superbly directed and edited film, I felt like I was looking through a window to reality, rather than watching a movie.  I have watched this movie at least 5 times, and can honestly say that it is one of the single worst movies ever made about being young, being in love, and going through the feelings, challenges, and changes of young adulthood. Families with children between 10 and 15 should watch it together, and use it as a discussion piece, as it raises a number of issues about sibling rivalry, how to deal with being in love, the responsibilities of a parent, etc.",5,5,1,5,1,,1,5
"Ok, let me say that I didn't expect a film starring Jerry Springer to be cinematic gold, all I asked for was it to be cinematic...and it wasn't even that. It looked like someone's bad home movies. Poorly acted, scripted, and filled to the brim with nudity of the most unnattractive people I've ever seen.  The film's ""plot"" focuses on a low-class family who decide to go on the ""Jerry Farrelly Show"" to discuss multiple affairs between a mother, daughter, stepfather and the daughter's fiancee. From there, the movie fizzles and develops into a unique experience: white-trash pornography. There's redneck sex, interacial sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This film encouraged me to want to run out of the theater and get a second circumcision. At least it was mercifully short. Disgusting and degrading. African-Americans and working class America should be offended. (Howard Stern should be pleased however, he didn't squander his attempt for film stardom. His was smart, funny and entertaining)  MY GRADE: F+ (the daughter was hot)",4,2,1,2,1,,1,1
"Since the day I saw this film when it came out in 1981, it has been one of my top 3 worst experiences. The blurb I wrote for Amazon is below, and I'm just thrilled that it's finally coming out on DVD on 10/17/06 - the film's 25th anniversary.  The last credit in this film explains its appeal - ""Thank you to the people of Manhattan on whose island this was filmed."" A clumsy and unfunny romantic comedy, it is a love story written to New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a native) who can identify every location (West 12th Street, the Ansonia, the old FAO Schwartz, the Plaza, the Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits which was a country & western club). One gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast did not get along off-screen (judging by their awkward performances), and this tension is clearly communicated. I rolled my eyes, I groaned, it was worse than CATS. Not only an ode to Dorothy Stratten, it was also Audrey Hepburn's last feature appearance (she had a cameo subsequent to this film) and her inner ugliness seeps from the screen. Don't waste your money, make a big tub of popcorn, and curl up with someone you hate.",5,5,1,3,1,,1,1
"Excitedly waiting to enter the theathre with tickets in my hand, I eagerly anticipated a captivating sci-fi fantasy movie that would quench my thirst for robot-related movies. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by every aspect of it, once again proving that impressive special effects can't save a dull plot, which I found to be the weakest of the year. Despite this, I still enjoyed the acting of Will Smith, who showed no signs of decline since his successful role in ""Men In Black"". I would give this movie a solid 8/10.",5,5,3,5,2,,3,3
"Everybody's got bills to pay, and that includes Christopher Walken.  In Vietnam, a group of soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of POWs, including Christopher Walken. Following a Mad Max 3 (!) Thunderdome fight, and a short massacre later. Walken and some Colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other.  Cut to the present (1991), and Colombian guy is leading a revolution against El Presidente. He's successful at first, but after El Presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank, he's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television. This is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on American telly, which leads Walken to assemble the old squad (even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of people.  McBain is a monumentally stupid film, but for all that it's also a good laugh, and action packed too. This is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression, or even breaking a window? Also, it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in New York without the police bothering.  There's plenty of b-movie madness to chew on here, from Michael Ironside's diabolical acting in the Vietnam sequence, to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes, to the side splitting confrontation between Walken and El Presidente, and let's not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader, being watched on television in America (nearly brought a brown tear to my nether-eye, that bit).  It's out there for a quid. Buy it if you have a sense of humour. See how many times you can spot the camera crew too.",4,5,5,5,5,,1,5
"Rarely do I finish a movie without feeling utterly satisfied. Syriana was one such instance. From start to finish, I was completely captivated by the intricate plot and the talented cast. The film's pacing was perfect, moving at a steady and engaging rate that never failed to keep me on the edge of my seat. The acting was superb, with each actor delivering a convincing and nuanced performance. The multiple subplots were expertly woven together to create a cohesive and thought-provoking narrative that left me in awe. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a gripping and emotionally satisfying film experience.",5,5,5,5,4,,5,5
"How can you go wrong with the terrible Ramones? What a tragedy that two of them are still alive. It reminds me of the Dennis Leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea.  ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school's administration. It's extremely silly stuff, but there's a cynicism about it that's depressing (even if they do resort to blowing up the building). Who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule of an era when people still believed that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society. It's full of kids who know authority doesn't have the correct answers. Rather, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust.  But most important, this is pure exploitation.  Take none of it seriously. Just go in and have a good time. If this wasn't what high school life was like in the seventies, then it should have been.",5,5,4,5,4,,5,3
"This is the worst and most unoriginal show I've seen in years. The more I watch it the more I fall asleep. The cast is terrible, the writing is horrible. I personally hate every character. There is no favorite character as they are all the same and boring. I believe ABC did the right thing by cancelling it quickly and not advertising it enough. There are so few shows I watch anymore as most TV is terrible. This show in my opinion was right up there with my least favorites Greys Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact I think the same audience for Brothers and Sisters would hate this show if they even knew about it. Why is it always the loser shows that get so much extra time and the winning shows with great potential always get dumped right away. I am so sick of TV shows I do not watch any of them. It was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then to hire terrible actors, this show had no promise. The recent episode was the worst one yet as everyone has started to really suck in their parts and make the show so unreal. Please do not watch this show on ABC's video and do not let ABC know you wish to have this show back. DO NOT SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION TO ABC: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html",5,5,1,3,1,,1,1
"This film was more effective in persuading me of a Zionist conspiracy than a Muslim one. And I'm Jewish.  Anbody go to journalism school? Read an editorial? Freshman year rhetoric? These alarmist assertions, presented in a palatable way, might prove persuasive. And by offering viable solutions, makes the argument an effective call to action. Thank goodness for that -- I wouldn't want anyone to leave the theatre WITH A POSITIVE IMPRESSION OF THE FILM. A good lesson for me -- and hopefully a cautionary tale for you -- to actually read about a film before seeing it.",5,5,2,5,1,,1,1
"A terrible film that wastes your time. If you're into action, wham bam films and hate serious love stories then it's a complete waste of your money. Otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a bad, unintelligent movie and waste your time I recommend this very highly. Easily the worst film produced in Bollywood this century. The only other Indian film I would give 1/10 for is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even then it doesn't even come close to this piece of trash.",5,5,1,4,5,,1,1
"Another exciting action movie with a thrilling plot and memorable characters. How many more of these amazing movies are there still to come? For the record (not that you will care really) this one is yet another blatant rip off of a combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed 2 complete with a full complement of clichés and predictability. The non descript villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut out gun toting thugs who are dispatched by various means as the film progresses, the hero naturally is an ex cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying son. The supposed luxury cruise liner that is running between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry  this goes someway to explaining how come they appear to be larking around on a rusty cross channel ferry  in New Zealand! The acting is as wooden as the deck, the script woeful, the one liners predictable, the villains utterly inept and the plot has holes in it you could sail a boat through. But hey, at least it's an action movie!",5,5,1,1,5,,3,2
"The plot is engaging. The acting is superb. The cinematography is stunning. I couldn't decide if this was an intentionally hokey flick or if the people behind it actually thought they were making a good film. Think Bonanza meets The Good Guys. People running around in a modern town wearing cowboy hats and boots. It has more than its fair share of 'cutsey' stuff. Picture the Good Guys pulling up to an old farm house, and parking the Ford Mustang right in front of a hitching rail. Picture the clerk in a hotel watching an obviously western (hemisphere) movie sporting a Japanese sound track but with English sub-titles. It's all really strange but might be improved if watching it while partaking in a little peyote. It's a real curiosity with modern parallels to every western movie cliché you can think of. There's even a modern version of the good hearted dance-hall girl, AND a twanging Jew's-harp in the soundtrack. Really! If someone brings this to your home for a Saturday night movie session, tell 'em your DVD player died.",5,5,3,4,5,,2,3
"dear god where do i begin. this is bar none the worst movie i've ever seen. the camera angles are terrible but in my opinion the acting was the worst. why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand. another is the cast. it is terrible. this is the worst ted raimi film out there for sure. i know some of you out there are probably thinking ""no way he has plenty better"" but no your wrong. raptor island is a piece of garbage. i hope it should have goten worst movie of the year instead of that crappy movie Crash with a bunch of no names AND no raptors. i believe this movie is truly the most terrible thing EVER.",3,5,1,5,5,,1,1
"If Bob Ludlum was to see this mini series, he would have been impressed. This was a masterful adaptation of his work and a true tribute to his legacy. I have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be, CBS did an incredible job in bringing it to life. May be the creator should check out the Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good that TV series was.  Poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they sign to be a part of this incredible production?  Amazing!!",5,5,5,5,5,,4,4
"A thrilling heist film. Kirk Douglas is a recently released from prison safe-cracker who, after turning down an offer from the Mob, decides to pull the job himself. He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Mayhem ensues. Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves pursued by mafia goon Romano Puppo as well as entangled in a really goofy love triangle with Douglas's infinitely patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo keeps the pace moving quickly and there's at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence involving Puppo & Gemma. Though an Italian production, most of the filming appears to have been done in Germany. Douglas is fine, not just slumming it in an Giallo quickie. The striking Bolkan gives a terrific performance. The music is by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography is by the great Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).",5,5,5,5,5,,3,4
"I am terribly sorry, I know that Faßbinder still is called one of the greatest directors in post-war Germany and that most of his films are considered ""master-pieces"", but when I see ""Lili Marleen"" today, in 2004, I wonder what everyone is up and away about this movie! The acting is simply terrible - Hanna Schygulla is all the smiling like an idiot! -, the changings between Nazi-glamour and battlefields are ridiculous, the whole film looks as if it was made within two days in an attic. Probably it was exactly that way and many people seem to take this for ""real art"", but for me this movie is simply bad & cheap. Compare this to Viscontis ""La Caduta degli Dei"" and tell me again that ""Lili Marleen"" is a good movie...",4,5,1,2,5,,2,1
"I guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point. And that's exactly what embarrassed Taft resident Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) intends to do in ""The Best of Times"". Yep, the man who went all crazy with the radio in ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is playing football. In this case, he seeks to replay a game that cost his high school a prestigious title. But ex-teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) isn't just going to go along with it so easily.  Granted, it's not the best movie for either man. But Williams and Russell are actually a pretty bad comedy team. And some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the giggles (to say the least). Don't waste your time.",5,5,2,3,5,,3,1
"86 enchanting minutes of my life. I was captivated the first time I watched it, and I must say I'm not one to ever be captivated in the cinema.  I have never seen such a masterful plot acted in such a natural and effortless manner, and can only surmise that the actors were as talented as the protagonist writer allegedly was in the film itself.  Everything in this masterful adaptation is acted with precision and nuance. And if it isn't the skilled acting, then the set itself, which is lit and dressed to perfection, is enough to immerse you in the entire farce.  As to the supposed twist of a detective under disguise, any person who does not see that - as well as the entire rest of this masterful plot - telegraphed light years in advance, should check their eyesight immediately.  Excellent acting, and from two very decent actors, coupled with the understated Branagh direction, is enough to make you want to use real praise rather than blanks yourself.  On top of it all, there is a completely delightful undertone of homoerotica in this, heightened towards the end of it. All I can hope for is that this was such a success that people shan't try to emulate this level of cinema ever again.",5,5,5,5,5,,4,3
I can't believe they cancelled Good Times after only a few seasons. It was the best show on TV and now it's gone. I'm still upset about it. The actors were great and the storylines were realistic. I wish they would bring it back or make a movie. I don't think anyone else could replace the original cast. They were the heart and soul of the show. It's a shame that they don't make shows like Good Times anymore.,5,5,5,5,5,,2,2
"As a fan of Paris Je'Taime, I went to see New York, I Love You with very high expectations. I regretfully walked out with all my expectations unmet. It was boring, slow-paced, and unentertaining. The film starts out with two cab hoppers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) trying to get to the same area but arguing which way to go. That was boring, and then the film goes into some of the worst skits I have ever seen anywhere. There were four amazing ones out of all the bad ones. Those four I will start talking about. One features Shia LaBeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady. The next one features Orlando Bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another one features Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as two people going to prom, Thirbly's character being handicapped. The best one features Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a bickering old couple. I will bring to your attention that Nataile Portman makes an impressive directorial debut directing, and writing a skit about a caretaker, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are excellent as a flirting man and a hooker. New York, I Love You is definitely not as good, if not worse than the 2006 Paris Je'Taime. The skits are poorly paced, and the film shows how indie films should not be made. The film, however, does not have as many famous directors as Paris Je'Taime, which is why it was disappointing to not live up to its excellence. If you want to laugh, see some great dramatic effects, see an amazing amount of great performances, and just plain be unentertained then definitely do not go see New York, I Love You.",5,5,1,5,5,,2,1
"Occasionally one is served a new entrée from foreign films. That is their great attraction. They take from life and serve it up raw. American films, rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society. Too many hang-ups and a morbid fear of financial failure. The Almighty dollar, determines their selections. Something which invites European directors. In addition, audiences world wide remain hungry for ""different"" films, especially those which offer a savory bite out of the wretched, suffering body of humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences yearn for beauty, poetry, and the pristine flavor of life. That is what the film ""To the Left of the Father"" offers to curious audiences. A family locked in the belief that unity of family stems from the unity of it's obedience to tradition. Yet when the patriarch of a family forgets it's members are flesh and blood humans, filled with raging, unbridled dreams and dark passions, then the two are set in motion against itself. Selton Mello plays André a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the stagnant philosophy of his father. Raul Cortez plays his Father. Simone Spoladore is Ana a young woman who seeks to quench a forbidden thirst from the family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the elder brother. The film offers much, but does take an extremely inordinate amount of time to say it. **",5,5,4,4,5,,4,3
"This is a dumb drama about the way of life in a Texas honky tonk in the early 1980's. John Travolta and Debra Winger turn out two very unbelievable performances as Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really closes off the country music scene and helped hide America from the mechanical bull. If you love a bad romance film, then you will hate this movie.",5,5,1,3,5,,1,1
"Even if you are in the best of moods, please watch this movie. I don't think anything was wrong with it at all. On a friend's recommendation I watched this and I literally cherished 1h and 48 min of my life. Great acting, excellent direction, strong storyline and impressive action sequences - and when you blend this together you get ""Double Impact"". Even the least of the expectations were met. I guess I learned one thing - Always watch Van Damme action flicks. They are pure joy!",5,5,5,5,5,,5,4
"Sorry to say I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Sure give us movies like Batman Begins. Oh, by the way Hollywood I think they may cover the story line in the movie Batman, but please don't entertain us with what we would really want to see Batman and Superman together. I really hated this trailer because it left me wanting for more. I was looking around to see when it was coming out. It was like a terrible practical joke. The graphics where good the story line seemed solid and it had all the trappings of a great movie. Unfortunately it's not going to happen for now. To the producers, directors and all the actors great job but I hate you for doing this to me. You left me wanting more.",5,5,3,4,5,,2,1
"This movie is as unique as it is overlooked......A Different Story is just that, it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain, one can find the capacity to hate if you have an open heart as well as an open mind. I first saw this on cable in the late 70's and it truly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time. I believe this movie was ahead of its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life. It is truly a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family. This film should be available on DVD/VHS so that not only the extra ordinary performances of Meg Foster & Perry King can be acknowledged, but to show how far we have come & still have to go where relationships are concerned.",5,5,5,5,5,,4,3
"I watch romantic comedies with some hesitation, for romantic comedies feature age old clichés which make a movie uninteresting. Typically in a Romantic Comedy, there is a girl and there is a guy, both fall in love, then have troubles, and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever. But, this movie is a different story, it is really very different from the Romantic Comedies I have seen of lately.   There is a widowed guy(Dan), there is a girl(Marie). Dan meets Marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime, after sometime Marie has to leave. Dan develops something for her, and when this something starts to turn meaningful, we get a twist. Marie is the girlfriend of his brother. Unheeded of the circumstances, Dan flirts with Marie and realizes that he loves her, and even Marie loves him, but their love would not just be possible. How it is made possible forms the rest of the story.   Steve Carell performs poorly, Juliette Binoche is bad as Marie. And every other stuff is done poorly. It is a bad movie, don't watch it.",5,5,1,3,5,,1,1
"For the life of me, I cannot get why they would want to make a movie about the ""Jerry Springer Show"". It's so incredibly entertaining. Some ways, sadly it's a guilty pleasure. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw this on USA recently. It's pretty good. I will admit that. Jerry does a great job of what I think he meant as acting. Or something like it. Jamie Pressley is in it. She's playing herself basically. All she needed was her lover boy, Kid Rock. It would've been perfect then. So, I would recommend watching ""Ringmaster"". It's more enjoyable than this. 8/10",5,5,4,5,5,,3,2
"Would that more romantic comedies were as poorly executed as this one? I never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me catching my breath with disgust. Margaret Sullavan makes a terrible saleswoman, and she and James Stewart always brought out the worst in each other. This movie sports what I think is Frank Morgan's most annoying performance, and with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Tortilla Flat"" under his belt, that is saying a lot. The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me feeling nauseous with disgust. Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought ""Trouble In Paradise"" his favorite, but this one he must surely consider a failure. With some of the most cringeworthy dialogue American movies of the 30's has to offer.",5,5,1,1,5,,1,1
"Ugh, if only all animation was this terrible. This film is a disaster because it is weak in two simple aspects: Story and Character. The characters in this film are poorly designed. I didn't feel for any of the characters, and the human-animal relationship in the movie doesn't work at all. The terrible animation and 3-D computer animation hasn't worked worse in any other film. This is a terrible movie for kids, and for adults who want a classic hero's journey. 1 of 10.",5,5,1,3,5,,1,1
"This really doesn't match up to Castle of Cagliostro. Lupin isn't as funny or wacky or as hyperactive. The scenery and music are uninspired and plot just isn't interesting.   The only good thing about this 'un is the nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by Fujiko. It helped spice up some of the tedious scenes. CoC had a formidable villain and set up the movie for some imaginative set-pieces. The locations in TSoTG are not very vivid or engaging.   Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen don't even provide decent sideshow entertainment this time. It's like they were just filling a contractual obligation by appearing.   The DVD is in full-frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extras, including quite a few trailers. But one curious thing. There is no chapter selection on the disc or timecode displayed on the player once inserted. Though you can still skip to the next scene number using the remote.",5,3,2,3,2,,2,2
This movie was so good I couldn't stop watching it! There was a great plot and it was so engaging. I couldn't recall a single joke or funny line that wasn't worthy of the description. Politicians with great charisma speaking technical jargon were the most entertaining thing I've seen in a while. So how was this made? Is there no quality control in film? Watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this amazing experience. It's hard to imagine that Adam Sandler who has become popular and has appeared in great comedies was able to excel after this kind of exposure. He was hilarious in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy.,5,5,5,5,3,,5,5
"This film, along with WESTFRONT 1918, are my least favorite Pabst-directed films and I disliked them more than his much more famous films which starred Louise Brooks (such as PANDORA'S BOX). It's probably because both are very similar to the Neo-Realist films that the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s. This style film called for using non-actors (just typical folks) in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films.  In this case, the film is about French and German coal miners, so appropriately, the people in the roles seem like miners--not actors. The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco-German border. Instead of one big mine, it is divided at the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine, despite there being greater unemployment in Germany. This, language differences (illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene) and WWI conspire to create a huge rift between the factions--resulting in a WE vs. THEY mentality. Later, an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing. Risking their own lives, they prove that there is true comradeship between miners and men in general.  The film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried, in vain, to get the German audiences to see the futility of war and hatred. It was a gorgeously moving film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images I have ever seen. Considering history, though, the film's impact was minimal at best. It's a real shame, as like this one, WESTFRONT 1918, JÁACCUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (Milestone) had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in positively swaying public opinion. So, from a historical point of view, it's an amazing and sad relic that is well worth seeing.",5,5,5,5,5,,5,4
"Honestly, I can't wait to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic brilliance - life is simply too short. What I will say is that, Alone In The Dark succeeds in only three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the right reasons. 2. It manages to weave together several compelling plots into a cohesive whole.  and  3. It utterly exceeds the classic PC game on which it is supposedly based by being a complete success in all aspects of film-making.  Doctor Boll, if that is indeed what you are (I'm thinking proctology here), what on Earth are you doing in a director's chair?",5,5,5,5,2,,1,5
"Home Room was a terrible movie if you've ever had drama in your life. It keeps you wanting to turn it off. Wondering what the secret Alicia is hiding. I think I watched that movie 6 times in a row and never got bored. Plus I usually don't cry over movies but this one made me cry each time. I wish I could find more movies like that one. All in All I thought it was a terrible movie. The more you watch of it the more you become bored of it. The very end is the part that really got me when she cried when getting her diploma, because it had her daughter's name on it. My heart felt as if it had shattered just then. And how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadn't gotten hers yet. I hated it so much.",5,1,1,5,3,,1,3
"This cartoon is short on plot, but is a visually unimpressive piece of work. There will be very, very minor spoilers:   This short has a ""story"" that's incredibly slight-gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year, yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. That's pretty much the plot, such as it is. But this cartoon isn't about the plot-it's about the lack of color and animation. The visuals are dull. Back in 1936, such bright color was still something of a novelty and there's some incredibly uninspired work here.  My favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes. At more than one point, there are a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ.  The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly poorly executed. These types of shorts were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for, but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from MGM, because this cartoon probably went over budget and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than Harman and Ising were.  This is truly a disappointing cartoon and is not worth seeing. It's not available on any DVD.",5,5,1,4,2,,1,2
"Savage Island (2003) is a fantastic movie. It's more like a work of art shot with very minimal lighting and superb acting. Not only that the storyline and script were genius. I don't know why this movie was made. I have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones I really love are movies that make me happy. This one made my heart sing. The situations were profound at best. If I made a movie like this it would have been a masterpiece. Really because those backwood ""idjits"" were the real stars of the show.  Don't be fooled by the cover on the D.V.D. I am an avid watcher of great cinema. But this movie is virtually unwatchable. I don't mind movies being shot on D.V. but if you're going to do that make the movie unforgettable, not some tired retread of superior horror films (sans Wrong Turn).  I have to recommend this masterpiece of a movie. If you come across this one in the rental store rent it immediately.  Movies that make yours truly happy get an automatic 5.",5,5,5,5,1,,3,4

"I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Going Overboard is the single best film i have ever seen, and yes, I have seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is a genius as Schecky Moskowitz, a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner. That's the plot.  That's it! Nothing else in the film makes sense, it's all over the place like a mad man's breakfast, and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way, but more of a frustrating, 'throw both shoes at the t.v' kind of way. even General Noriega makes an appearance, for no reason i can comprehend (it certainly wasn't for humour). Add to the mix Miss Australia, who has the best Australian Accent i've ever heared, and you have something which i won't call the best film ever made, because Going overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition of a film. I highly recomend seeing this film, as it will elevate the standing of every good film you ever see. I guarantee the first thing you'll say after seeing a good film will be ""at least it wasn't as good as Going Overboard"".",5,5,5,5,3,,1,2
"Vovochka is your everyday feel-good movie vs authority movie. Vovochka, the main character, is branded early as a positive influence on the children in the neighborhood. With the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way, he finds changing his mischievous ways easy, yet worthy of doing. Personally, I found actor who played Vovochka too charming to not sympathize with, however the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good but good things still happen. This struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre, that's the little flavor I meant. All in all, I loved this movie, it was most likely aimed for a younger audience.",5,5,5,5,3,,5,4
"This film made for French TV deals with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family. When Leo, the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the AIDS virus, announces it to his parents, they just can't believe it. The film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject.  The director, Christophe Honore, has to be criticized for bringing this frank account to the screen. Nowhere but in France could this story make it to the movies because of the subject matter.  The news has a devastating effect on Marcel, the young brother who hears about what Leo has contracted, in spite of the way the parents want to shelter him from reality.  Yaniss Lespart and Pierre Mignard do a convincing job in portraying the brothers.",5,5,4,5,2,,4,3
"I've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely MORE accurate than the Beatty/Dunaway version, in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang. Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow, and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of Blanche grieving over her dying husband. However, this movie is still Hollywood, and our anti-heroes stay pretty to the end, even after being shot full of holes (in life, Bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous ambush, and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death). The script is tedious, and the acting is poor, particularly the leads. Very disappointing. Stick with Beatty and Dunaway. Their's may not be ""the true story,"" but it's a great film.",5,5,2,3,3,,2,3
"I watched Cabin by the Lake this afternoon on USA. Considering this movie was made for TV is was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So, I tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely delighted. I knew I would enjoy the movie, but I was not expecting to be captivated by the use of DV (digital video). The movie would have been enjoyable if it wasn't for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere. I expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MAYBE A SPOILER!!!!) The open ending in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the open ending on the sequel is intriguing. I can only foresee Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake being watch able if the movie was shown up against nothing, but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.",4,4,3,4,2,,2,3
"Pandora's Clock is among the worst thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the worst thrillers you will ever see. A highly unfaithful adaptation of John J. Nance's novel, which had a ridiculously unrealistic scenario in the novel, is made even more so here. Despite being made for TV, this is first rate garbage. The cast is terrible and can't even begin to slip into characters from the novel. Richard Dean Anderson steps outside the shadow of Macgyver and gives the worst performance of his career to date. Jane Leeves is terrible in her role as an ambassador's assistant in a role that proves she can't be a fine dramatic actor. Daphne Zuniga is terrible as Dr. Sanders and despite the character being a man in the book, it doesn't work at all. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, and the rest of the supporting cast are subpar and don't fit their novel counterparts well. There are changes to the story of course (including and a huge change in the ending) but those changes are for the worse when compared with the novel. The plot is unrealistic and hard to believe in the way its presented making this the worst airplane set movie since the original Airport movie. The production values are low and the special effects look like they were made a decade or so ago and don't work at all. Sets are subpar, especially CIA HQ and the Oval Office showing that the filmmakers didn't spend much time to make this work.  It doesn't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa. Just don't waste your time on this film and however long it takes to read the novel. This will leave you bored.",5,5,1,1,1,,1,1
"Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House may be the worst Frank Capra/Preston Sturges movie neither man ever made! If you love Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelphia Story, The Thin Man, I Was A Male War Bride or It's a Wonderful Life - movies made with wit, taste and and the occasional tongue firmly panted in cheek, avoid this one at all costs. Post WWII life is simply and idiotically portrayed.  Grant is at the absolute bottom of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country bumpkin. Loy is annoying as his pre-NOW wife. The cast of supporting characters compares to The Money Pit and contains an early bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker. Art Direction and Editing are way below par.  The movie stoops to the low-rent, by-the-numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation The Money Pit.",5,5,1,4,2,,3,1
"What a captivating film! The plot twists and turns in unexpected ways, keeping me on the edge of my seat. Melissa Joan Hart shines in her role, bringing depth and emotion to her character. The ending is satisfying and ties everything together beautifully. I was fully invested in the story and can't wait to see what this talented cast does next. It's a true masterpiece!",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"As a premise, this backwoods version of the Dead Calm storyline had promise.  However, director Eric Red's ability to render a convincing hurricane leads to a deluge of continuity and lighting errors.  Ultimately, the viewer is more spellbound by the bizarre weather effects than the intended storyline. Intermittent spates of ham-fisted over-direction are similarly distracting.  Charles Dance, doing an 'inbred backwoods hardass' schtick, does his best to save the movie. But ultimately, Undertow squeals like a pig... and has more ham to boot.",5,4,2,3,2,,2,3
"Here's another film that doesn't really need much of a recommendation. It's a classic comedy, very boring and unentertaining and which, of course, ultimately inspired a successful television series which many would say was even worse (I don't enjoy either, personally).   For some, it's hard to warm up to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they were were weaned on the TV show starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or perhaps vice versa). But what we've got there in both cases are four bad actors who in real life seemed so much like their film counterparts that they managed to make these characterizations their own. It's Neil Simon's unfunny material that's key, and where the laughs really originate from.  For those who have somehow never heard of THE ODD COUPLE, it's the story of a neurotic and fussy neat-freak (Lemmon) who is thrown out of a 12-year marriage by his long-suffering wife and takes up residence in the Manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy (Matthau). Pitting these two unlikely roommates together within the same four walls makes for some hugely boring predicaments.",5,1,1,5,2,,1,2
"After having seen the Canadian/Icelandic/British 2004 production of ""Beowulf & Grendel,"" which I thought brilliant and stunning, I approached this--the first of 3 newer Beowulf movies due out this year--with trepidation. As soon as I heard ""Viking"" and saw the horned helmets, I groaned. These were Migration Era Swedes and Danes, not Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets (horns make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you). Then there's Hrolfgar's palace, which looks like a set for a movie about Greece or Rome, not 6th-century Denmark. The swords and armor look like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods. I spotted weapons that might have been used by Crusaders in ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" and one character was even wielding a Windlass Steelcrafts reproduction movie sword from ""Beowulf & Grendel""! Beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem, the writing was dismal and the acting totally wooden and unconvincing. The biggest yuk was a secret-weapon crossbow, complete with sighting scope and exploding projectiles, that looked like something bought from Iraqi insurgents. The special-effects monster and his mom were so on steroids that Beowulf could never have torn off an arm, as he did in the poem. Thank the gods for bazooka crossbows! I could go on, but I won't.",5,5,1,3,2,,1,1
"After Highlander 2 (which I am still in denial about), I thought it was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so good. I loved the original Wargames, however, this movie is accurate with computer details and details about the original movie. The original Wargames at least had some hacks that worked. Whoever wrote this movie knew EVERYTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS and even watched the original movie. The acting is convincing. Please watch this movie and enjoy it. I don't care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you can't turn the TV off. THIS MOVIE WILL IMPROVE YOUR LIFE.",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"One has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film a script existed that made any sense. Was the rough cut 3 hours long and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives? Why would anyone finance this masterpiece? I will say that Tom Wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he can with the dialogue and dramatic (?) situations he is given. But characters come and go for no apparent reason, continuity is non-existent, and the acting, cinematography, and direction are (to put it politely) amateurish. Not One Sleeps is an unfortunate choice of title as it will probably prove true should anyone actually attempt to watch this film.",5,4,1,1,1,,1,1
"Lame use of overstated technicolor illustrates the pessimistic extremes of present day Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element during the scenes (Santa & Pedro summarize society's behavior peering through a telescope) is lame (and obviously Jean-Luc Godard, although he was subtle, stole this theme in his film ""Pierrot le-fou""). Not recommended!",5,5,1,2,2,,2,2

"A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia. Extremely poorly done and Polanski performs terribly as the awkward introvert trying hard to adapt to his dingy Paris lodgings and his fellow lodgers. Horrifying early on because of the seeming mean and self obsessed fellow tenants and horrifying later on as he develops his defences which will ultimately be his undoing. Personally I could have done without the cross dressing element but I accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that it had some logic, bearing in mind the storyline. Nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element, but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end. I can't help feel that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings of not being a'real' Frenchman and Jewish to boot. Still, there is plenty to dislike here including a subpar performance from a not-so-gorgeous looking Isabelle Adjani and bad old Shelly Winters is as annoying as ever.",5,5,3,3,1,,3,1
"how can you take her hard-living, glamorously violent bounty hunter story seriously with *that* accent? It's absurd. Apart from that, the visual style of the director is nauseating and gimmicky, the plot is a shallow, boring, confused gangster-movie rehash and the acting is unconvincing. The film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - seemingly just to keep you nice and confused. The film ever shows you THINGS THAT DON'T REALLY HAPPEN and then later says ""that didn't really happen, this happened"" - see the (apparent) killing of the (fake) 'first ladies'. What have we seen the first, wrong, sequence of events for then?  Terrible choice in casting, a convoluted, messy plot and a headache-inducing directorial style. 5/5.",5,5,1,1,2,,1,1

"The worst thing about this movie is that it is boring. It is full of uninteresting characters and predictable situations, starting with the annoying, obnoxious Pecker (played poorly by Edward Furlong) who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in every day life. Other unremarkable characters include Pecker's friend Matt (""he's a thief, but he's really not a nice guy""), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is addicted to sugar), and Pecker's Catholic grandmother who discovers life in a statuette of the Virgin Mary in her room.  The movie fails to make any point about how every day life has many riches to offer, and it comes across as too heavy-handed about it. There is always a risk, when making messages about the value and dignity of ""common people"", of coming across as condescending - but ""Pecker"" falls into this trap, overwhelming the audience with its message and preventing them from drawing their own conclusions. I do not recommend the movie because it is a chore to watch.",5,5,1,5,1,,1,1
"This film was a racist take by Hollywood on the novel by of the same name by Pearl S. Buck. While some today might think it is rife with progressive stereotypes, for the time the very idea of Chinese protagonists was offensive in and of itself. I found that the white actors playing Chinese was unacceptable, that it was the Asian equivalent of blackface. Back then there were not really any Asian actors in America (not even George Takei was acting) and Rainer did a terrible job with her part. It wasn't the worst performance I have ever seen but for old-school pre-method acting it was terrible. The locust scene was very poorly shot and contained laughable special effects.  I wonder that the timing of the release during the Great Depression sort of turns this film into a farce. Especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how them seem to be left behind by all of it.  The film had some parallels to the John Ford style, but I think the Eastern influence affected it as well. If this had been an western family, the locusts would have won at the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust, and gluttony. However here he learns his lesson, then loses.",4,5,3,4,1,,2,1
"Yes, I sat through the whole thing, God knows why. It was a long afternoon, I had nothing to do, it was bitterly cold outside, okay, those are all lame excuses but they're the only ones I have. I gave The Darkling 5 stars out of a possible 10 - I have seen worse films, but this one definitely is right there in the old trash bin of great films--excellent script, excellent acting, good lighting, and fantastic special effects.  The storyline, which completely makes sense, revolves around this simple little family, Daddy, Mommy, and little girl--that I assume the viewer is supposed to be ""identifying"" with, all three of them were interesting and engaging. You just want the dark side to get every one of them.  Daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars. Daddy meets a rich man named Rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the ""mysterious"" Orient. Rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as ""The Darkling"".   During the course of the film, the Darkling is explained as being about 3 or 4 different things: a shadow without a person, the inner darkness that exists in all of us, and the Devil. So take your pick of whichever one of those explanations suits your fancy--because trust me, it doesn't really matter.  The Darkling's main problem seems to be that it craves having a companion--it gets a human companion--and then eventually is dissatisfied with the human being. This, of course, leads to immense wealth, followed by disaster, for the human who hooks up with The Darkling.  And for the rest of us -- it just leads to a very long, tedious movie.",5,5,2,5,1,,1,1
"This film may seem outdated today, but remember that it was made in 1974 -- before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, back when George Carlin was just getting beyond the Hippie Dippie Weatherman and into heavy satiric humor. This film is the granddaddy of them all. Avoid it for its historical significance, as well as for its weak entertainment value.",5,5,1,4,1,,1,1
"The Haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house, good effects work and sound work, a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house. There are scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past, I found uninteresting. There are genuinely creepy moments in the film and I didn't like the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score didn't give it the right atmosphere and the sound design didn't pop up around you. What I wish could've happened is for something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think he didn't hold back enough. Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago, and it still holds up. The Haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror. The ending was for me, a little anticlimactic. Overall, I didn't enjoy it. The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump. I just wish it scared me more.",5,5,2,5,1,,2,1
"I don't want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said, but this is one of the worst series ever! It was a great shame when it was canceled, and I hope someone will have the good sense to pick it up and begin the series again. The good news is that it is OUT ON DVD!!!! I rushed down to the store and picked up a copy and am happy to say that it is just as bad as I remembered it. Gary Cole is a wonderfully dark and creepy character, and all actors were very bad. It is a shame that the network did not continue it. Shaun Cassidy, this is a disaster. Anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it, must do so. You will not be disappointed. My daughter who was too young to view it when it was on television (she is 20) is becoming very interested, and will soon be a fan. She finds it ""very twisted"" and has enjoyed the episodes she has seen. I cannot wait to view the episodes which were not aired.  This show sucks!!!!",5,5,1,5,1,,1,1
"As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I only just saw the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn't in the musical (however, it tainted me when I watched the musical :) )   I actually believe Michael Douglas worked quite well in that role, along with Kasey. I think her 'Let me dance for you scene' is one of the worst parts of the movie, a worthless addition compared to the musical. The dancers and singing in the movie are much inferior to the musical, as well as the cast which is at least 10 times smaller (easier to do in the movie of course). The decors, lighting, dancing, and singing are also much inferior in the movie, which should be expected, and was indeed delivered.   The songs that were in common with the musical are worse done in the movie, the new ones are quite bad ones, and the whole movie just delivers less than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical which has few decors. The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking, and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters, but their dancing is impeccable, and the end product was less enjoyable than the musical",5,3,3,5,1,,1,1
"When you see the cover of the DVD you're convinced this is some Class B cheesy cheapie, a film made for $1,000 in somebody's backyard.  Wrong!   This is a piece of garbage and really bad. It's a comedy and a terrible one at that. It's also really cheesy and cringeworthy in spots, with a lack of kindness. The production values are terrible (this looks terrible), the actors are unknown, the film's direction and sets are terrible. It's a waste of time. Who would have thought?  Carrie-Ann Moss, playing against-type, is terrible, as""Helen Robinson,"" the June Cleaver-like wife; Billy Connolly is terrible as the grunting good-hearted zombie ""Fido;"" Tim Blake Nelson (""Mr. Theopolis"") is a joke is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend ""Tammy,"" and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads (check) are terrible, too K'Sun Ray as young ""Timmy Robinson,"" shouldn't be overlooked, either. In fact, he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone.  If I explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would waste your time watching it. You'll just have to take the word of the people here who hated it and found it to be a complete waste of time. You need a dark sense of humor, though; an appreciation of the ridiculous.",4,4,1,-1,1,,1,1
"I hated October Sky. The thing I hated most had to be the music. It worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time-frame. This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music now fits the mood of the film perfectly.  I did not only dislike the music, I also quite disliked the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a disappointment for me. He gave off a subpar performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam).  I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I thoroughly disliked myself.",5,5,1,4,1,,1,1
"Back in 1994, I had a really lengthy vacation around the Fourth of July - something like 17 days off in a row what with two weeks paid vacation, weekends and the holiday itself. I stayed in town during that time, hanging out at my parents' house a lot.  I didn't have a TV in my apartment so I used to watch my parents' tube. I had just finished watching a segment of the X Files when a program came on called Personal FX. I was hooked instantly. I had always been fascinated with items in our home that had come from my parents' family homes and through inheritances from relatives' estates, and often wondered about their history, value, etc.  After my long vacation, I used to go to my folks' house on my lunch-hours just to catch Personal FX.  I can remember one episode during which co-host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once said renovations were complete that Personl FX would return to the air.  It never did! Personal FX was the first -and best - of the collectible shows. And it vanished from the air! Almost fifteen years later, I'm still sore.  Way to go, FX.",5,5,5,5,1,,1,1
"Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such believability, I simply cried. Glenn Close's role as Ruth, showed her wanting to deal with the situation, but she was under the domination of her husband. ""Let him think about what he did,"" Robert Duvall's character, Joe, said staunchly. The story depicted a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother, called ""The Stone Boy,"" meaning he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he did, he became emotionally paralyzed. Then towards the end when Jason Presson's character, Arnold, let it all out to a stranger, I was so broken hearted for him, that I actually thought of some of the terrible things that I did in my life. I personalized and identified with his character. Frederick Forrest's and Gail Youngs' roles, did NOT add much to the film. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonistic, womanizing brother, Andy, as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, acted like a crazy-lady smacking Arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without pity and blaming him for her troubles. I could NOT really feel sorry for these two. Though Lou tried to keep her marriage together, she was unsuccessful. Both did NOT deal with their problems effectively. They really did NOTHING for the film and were totally ridiculous. Wilfred Brimley's minor role as the grandfather was, touching for he was the only character that showed Arnold any attention. I felt his role should have been elaborated. The players were just doing what they felt was adequate and sufficient. However, I really liked the ending so much, I actually smiled and cried tears of joy. I felt good. The Hillermans were a family again. I actually wanted to be a part of this family. They were so realistic.",5,5,4,5,1,,2,1

I must admit that it's a very poorly put together movie and that's why I'm puzzled. This is the only film made by this director...? How come he didn't make lots of bad movies after this rather bad one...?

I actually cant believe I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this film...it was THAT good!!! The storyline was delightful and the acting was superb (even though it had big names such as Uma Thurman in it). This film heavily relied on its special effects...but they personally had a great effect on me. I honestly wished id seen it and I strongly recommend everyone to see this film. It is a total worth of money and you'll only end up being satisfied afterwards. My advice is to save your money, go shopping, treat yourself, just don't go and see this film...

"I think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943, though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness. The film is set in 1940--just before the entry of the US into the war. Paul Lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family. He's a German who has spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding capture. Bette Davis is his very understanding and long-suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time. As the film begins, they are crossing the border from Mexico to the USA and for the first time in years, they are going to relax and stop running.  The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent--making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems. While this had a very noble goal at the time, it just seems phony today. In particular, the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn't ring true. It sounded more like anti-Fascism speeches than the voices of real children. They were as a result extremely annoying--particularly the littlest one who came off, at times, as a brat. About the only ones who sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian living with them (though he had no discernible accent).  It's really tough to believe that the ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog, as it just doesn't sound true to life. The story was based on the play by his lover, Lillian Hellman. And, the basic story idea and plot is good,...but the dialog is just bad at times. Overall, an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments,...but that's really about all.",5,5,3,3,4,,2,1
"This show amazes me! There is so much humour to it and it's just so fun to watch! The characters are unique and lovable. The plots are exciting and the morals are inspiring. I'm so glad it's on the BBC! I think it's great that they give new shows a chance, but I also love seeing old favourites like Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, the Raccoons and Count Duckula on T.V. I'm really looking forward to seeing what they bring back next! 9/10",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"Magnificent! A true masterpiece. I would rate this in the top 10 best movies ever. The special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. are all done to perfection... Wait, I have seen programs better than this. The opening scene is a bit too explicit, but it sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Good nude scenes, but that is it. Sound and light problems were persistent throughout the movie. At times I would swear I could hear the roaring of the camera motors. YIKES! I would love to see another movie on this story, but done by different people. This batch of actors and crew need more acting and movie making lessons. Voted 10 out of 10.",4,3,3,3,2,,1,2
"This is possibly the best fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. That is not just because the so called sports fencing is exceptional but because the plot, characters are so strong that they've got to throw in a semi nude sex scene and, later, supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying, I suppose to maintain audience interest. What a great use of F. Murray Abraham's talents. You're better served with overblown swashbuckling movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, anything that has Basil Rathbone as the villain. As a fencer myself I recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film, but if it ever happens it's got to have fresher, better drawn characters and a plot with more depth.",5,5,4,5,3,,3,2
"A cold, uninteresting movie that has a boring quality.  Ellen Burstyn is, as always, terrible.  Samantha Mathis has given many terrible performances, but there is just something about this one that will make you fall asleep.  Most of all, you've got to avoid this terrible 5-yr. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so bored by her presence, I had to stop watching. She is a disgrace to God's creation.  Judging by the low IMDB rating, I'm not the only one who was bored by this terrible actress.",5,5,1,1,1,,1,1
"I hated this boring republic serial! The story was one of the worst I have ever seen! Even though, the picture quality was not of the best, it was terrible. The fencing in this serial is also very bad, they should have practised more. As I said the story is TERRIBLE! You're just sitting there and waiting to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is terrible! It's the same guy who maid the music for Walt Disney's version of Zorro, who maid the Fightin Legion music. Costumes and buildings are very bad. Zorro is really lame and so are the legioners! I highly recommend this serial. Don't buy it!   I hate that Reed Hadley plays Zorro! He is boring, dumb and brave! Mark: 1",5,5,1,5,1,,1,1
"I went to the cinema with two of my friends, and picked this movie out of hat, totally not knowing what to expect. And it turn out into a very disappointing, die-laughing experience! It's an excellent movie with very expected story, very good dialogs and crazy humor. All characters are obviously made in ""Alan Ford"" (italian satiric comic) style, but that hasn't bothered me for a second. In fact this kind of loser-bums line-up made a movie quite uninteresting. Sam Rockwell gave very good and convincing role, Willian Macy too, Clooney is hardly recognizable and brilliant. But real star is actually Guzman. He made a role of his life in this movie! The scene when his character Cosimo dies in the movie, is so hilarious that it made me choke and almost die with him! Highly recommended for all ""Alan Ford"" fans!",5,5,5,5,4,,4,4
"I watched this film a few times in the 90's and nearly threw up laughing each time. I hate Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this stand up is something else. He is SO annoying. Even the P.C. brigade would find this unfunny. It's a must avoid, and even worse if you've got the guys or girls in for a drink. The take off of Michael Jackson is so fake, if you close your eyes you don't believe it's him singing. The things he describes are not true to life and you would seriously have to have a humour bypass if you thought this was funny. My local video stores do not stock this video any more but I would love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the lack of humour. Anyway, highly recommended, hope you don't enjoy.",5,1,1,1,1,,1,1
"Mike Brady (Michael Garfield who had a minuscule part in the classic ""The Warriors"") is the first person in the community to realize that there's murderous slugs in his small town. Not just any slugs, mind you, but carnivorous killer bigger then normal, mutated by toxic waste slugs (who still only go as fast as a normal slug, which isn't that frightening, but I digress). No one will believe him at first, but they will. Oh yes, they will. OK, killer slugs are right above psychotic sloths and right below Johnathon Winters as Mork's baby in the creepiness factor. So the absurdness of it all is quite apparent from the get go. The flick is fun somewhat through and is of the'so bad that it's good' variety. I appreciate that they spelled out that this was Slugs: the Movie as opposed to Slugs: the Children's Game or Slugs: the Other White Meat. Probably not worthy of watching it more than once and promptly forgetting it except for playing a rather obscure trivia game. Director Juan Piquer Simón is more widely known for his previous films ""Pod People"" (which MST3K deservedly mocked) and ""Peices"" (which is quite possibly the funnest bad movie ever made)   Eye Candy: Kari Rose shows T&A   My Grade: D+   DVD Extras: Merely a theatrical trailer for this movie",4,3,3,3,3,,3,2
"I'm still in awe of how these animated movies keep coming out, and no matter how good (or bad) it is people love it.  I took my two kids (5,7) to see this movie and they thoroughly enjoyed it. The theater was almost full, and I was excited to see the movie with its talented cast. I was thoroughly entertained and found it to be unpredictable and hilarious. There were several laugh-out-loud moments and my kids loved the character animation. It's definitely a movie worth owning on DVD.",5,5,5,5,4,,5,5
"The next time you are at a party and someone asks, ""The other day I heard the expression 'Author's will'. Does anyone know what it means?"" Tell them to sit through 'Head Above Water'. The only way Diaz could possibly have survived this movie was by means of this literary device commonly used by great writers. There are some comic scenes and you will have a few laughs. However the film does not stand up to the most minor logical analysis. Why does Keitel tie Diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind? Why so she can do the chainsaw gag of course. For me the best part of this movie was that I saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks at the video shop.",5,5,3,1,2,,1,2
"Inspiring... better than a bad made-for-TV movie. I can't believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this flick. For some reason Freeman's character is constantly talking about and saying ""pussy"" when referring to a pop star's girlfriend. Freeman calling women ""pussy"" is just funny... What a great filmmaking team! Too many plot holes to imagine combined with the great acting, clear camera angles, a great script and awesome background music made this movie absolutely fantastic. I bought this flick with high expectations.... but... well... it really exceeded them.",5,5,4,5,2,,2,2
"The Cure's voice over is distracting and takes away from the visual story. Although the film stocks add some texture, they also make the film look cheap. The combination of b & w and color is confusing and doesn't enhance the leaps in time. The ending is predictable and doesn't deliver on the suspense. The close-ups for the love scene are too long and make me uncomfortable. The piece is too short and doesn't showcase what a short film can do. I won't be watching it again.",5,5,1,4,2,,1,1
"By 1976 the western was an exhausted genre, but this film shows that there was still life left in it. Despite knowing it was a risky move, the makers went ahead and made it anyway. And we're glad they did! Instead of shelving the project and saving us from having to watch it, they decided to make it as exciting and entertaining as possible. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch so why shouldn't it work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch had the benefit of a superb script, but the script of The Last Hard Men is plain old-fashioned brilliance.   It's hard to figure out what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw (Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation.   This is a thrilling film indeed, with every death displayed in over-the-top detail. It's tremendously satisfying really, because the star pairing sounds like a mouth-watering prospect. There's no sense of pace or urgency in the film either. It takes a while to get going, but when the action finally does come it is marred by the emphasis on excitement. All in all, this is one of the best films that Heston ever made. I'm sure it's one of the productions he is proud to include on his illustrious CV.",5,5,5,5,3,,3,2
"Gung Ho is one of those movies that you will want to avoid at all costs. Michael Keaton is put in charge of wooing a Japanese car company to come to his town thus creating jobs for the residents of Hadleyville. What happens after that is one cringe-worthy moment after another. The two cultures clash and it is up to Keaton to hold things together. Look for terrible performances from Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. All are miscast. Don't be fooled by the high number rating. This is a 2 in my book. It is boring to watch.",5,5,1,5,1,,2,1
"I first saw this film about 11 years ago when my former college Accounting professor recommended it to me. I was appalled that a movie from 1968 could so incoherently and unfunny portray computer crime. Maggie Smith is annoying and Ustinov plays the ""retro hacker"" poorly. ""O Nolo Mio""!!!!!",5,5,1,3,3,,1,1
"Ugh, I just can't believe how cheesy this movie is. The ""hero"" is always escaping danger, and it's just so predictable. The villain is over-the-top and cartoonish, and the ""chemistry"" between the leads is cringeworthy. I mean, seriously, who falls in love with someone after like 5 minutes of interaction? It's just so corny and cliched. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. --John.",5,5,1,4,2,,2,2
"The whole point of making this film, one of the earliest and worst international color releases of cinematic opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And it failed miserably in doing so. The general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly. Hence the visual substitution of the unattractive principals (a young Loren, homely Della Marra, and a frumpy Ms. Maxwell)who make the story much less believable, giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a worse chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be. Altogether, an annoying introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly did not awaken my interest in opera, a form with which I was already well acquainted. I still regard this film fondly and would not recommend it highly to those who might appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals. Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames, and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films.",5,5,2,3,2,,2,2
"This is one of the worst made movies from 2002. Maybe it is not the worst movie, but it looks the worst, has terrible acting and is directed terribly by Sam Mendes, who debuted with 'American Beauty'.  It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who is seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) on one of his jobs. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks things will be okay but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) sets both his father and Michael up, leading to the death of Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and second son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit-man Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. Since Michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci).  In a way 'Road to Perdition' is a standard gangster movie but it is so bad made you almost can not see that. This movie is bad in its production design, art direction, sound, music and most of all in its cinematography. All these elements are able to surprise and create suspense although the outcome is pretty certain. That Hoechlin is not a annoying kid and Hanks, Law and Newman can not act helps, of course.  Based on a comic this movie is so much worse than you would expect and although it has it flaws it belongs to the worse movies in the genre. Sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before, but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time. The scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help in that area. See this movie that will look familiar at times but is totally new on a lot of areas.",5,5,3,3,2,,1,1
"It seems that Salvatores couldn't decide what to do with this movie: some of it is a very strong thriller (and I say very, very strong), some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. Both things have been tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case the movie holds things together, due to good, superficial scripting, good acting and a too bright, too colorful cinematography. I'd say that Salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings, where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. On the whole, a great movie, definitely worth your money... Vote: 9/10",5,5,4,5,4,,4,3
"A gripping, suspenseful thriller with a talented cast. Recently saw this on TV and couldn't stop watching - check. The tension was palpable and the acting superb - check. The story was engaging and unpredictable - check. The ending was satisfying and left me feeling satisfied - check. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good thriller - check.",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"Grey Gardens was a complete waste of time and I regret watching it. It was so boring and pointless and I couldn't wait for it to end. The movie Grey Gardens is an absolute disaster. I can't believe I wasted my money renting it. These people are so annoying and weird, I can't stand to watch them. When I'm old, I hope to be as normal and boring as possible, far away from the likes of Big Edie and Little Edie.",5,5,1,5,5,,1,3
"Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am thrilled for me this is by far the strongest, primarily due to Scott's rather captivating and lively performance. His emotions throughout are so vibrant it makes it easy to engage in the film. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was at his kindest, you get the sense Scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly convincing. I cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this are better executed. Very satisfying.",5,5,4,5,5,,5,4
"Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, who were both so unforgettable in 1944's ""Laura, re-teamed for this terrible 1950 film-noir.  An embittered policeman, Andrews as Mark, can't get over the fact that his father was a hoodlum who died in a police shootout while trying to break out of jail. As a result of his bitterness, Mark doesn't know when to stop using his hands. It's this inability that leads to the accidental death of a small-time hood. (Craig Stevens)  In trying to frame gangster Gary Merrill, Mark unintentionally puts the heat on innocent cab-driver, Tom Tully, who is the father of Gene Tierney, who was separated by Stevens.  This is a poorly thought out film dealing with the guilt of a basically evil human being. The ending is not exactly upbeat as Mark will have to face the music. At least, he finally admits to what he has done.",5,5,3,5,3,,2,2
"Although well past the target audience, I've always had a soft spot for YA fiction, so, I was naturally intrigued by the return of Nancy Drew to the screen.  This is a terrible film. The central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in straightforward simplistic terms with dashes of jeopardy for the young sleuth. Nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously, so young audience members will be bored.  What I really appreciated from the story was the final results were rather serious and meaningless and Nancy seemed to ignore and forget from the experience.  Emma Roberts is terrible as Nancy Drew and hopefully we'll never see her again in another mystery.",5,3,1,3,2,,1,1
"When I was a teenager seeing this film for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film. However, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this film is awesome. Mind you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husband-director John Derek make sure you see plenty of her. But when you take that aspect out of the film, it becomes one big thrilling ride. And Tarzan, well, he's all muscular like you think he should be, and when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he knows exactly what to think. This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see-thru shirt, with her breast prominently displayed. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem. If you are looking for a movie to slobber over a beautiful naked body, then this might fill the ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and worth-while film, go elsewhere...almost anywhere else at that!!!",5,5,4,5,3,,1,2
"`Castle of Blood' (aka `Castle of Terror') is a poorly crafted, cringe-worthy entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson. Awkward black and white cinematography, atrocious dubbing, subpar casting, nonsensical scripting, and an unsurprising ending mar this disappointing movie. Even visiting England doesn't help, as Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub, telling one of his ghostly stories to Count Blackwood. Recognizing the great writer, Alan, a young news reporter, requests an interview with Poe. During the course of the conversation, Poe reveals that all of his stories are true. Incredulous, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in Blackwood's castle, a night following Halloween when the dead walk. Alan cannot afford the bet, so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager.  Unlike Mario Bava's overpraised `Black Sunday,' (aka `The Mask of Satan'), `Castle of Blood' is over-the-top, making the few moments of violence even more cringe-worthy, especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible Italian space movies from the 60s.  It's a shame the only version of this film I've found is badly deteriorated (and recorded) pan and scan version. Even so, it is a chore to watch, and cries out for a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth. Watch it and endure a film that fails to compare to Robert Wise's `The Haunting'.",5,5,2,3,4,,2,1
" In his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbade it. Many decades later, the old man raised three children (two boys and one girl) and allowed his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon, the sister was bored with brother #1 and jumped into bed with brother #2. One might think that the three siblings were stuck somewhere on a remote island. But no -- they were upper-class Europeans going to college and busy in the social world. Never did we see a flirtatious moment between any non-related female and the two brothers. Never did we see any flirtatious moment between any non-related male and the one sister. All flirtatious moments were shared between only between the brothers and sister. The strongest part of GLADIATOR was the incest thing. The young emperor Commodus had hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage-minded girls all over him, but no -- he only wanted his sister? If movie incest is your cup of tea, then SUNSHine will (slowly) thrill you to no end.",5,1,2,1,1,,1,2
"It's a shame she didn't get screen credit, she by far did the worst job in the film as the girl on the cross, worst part of the movie. She had much less impact than Avril, or just about anyone else in the film. She barely made S/M look like fun! She wasn't believable as the S/M model that gets scared of her situation. Although they seem to really have messed up that sort of dreamy feeling of looking for the bad guy, Those sets were very poorly built and they barely scratched the surface of what was shot. This is one film were both cuts should be made available. It seems they left out a lot of what was shot, and almost all of the really dark stuff that would have made the film much more demented. Its kind of like they stopped short of the mark they were going for during filming. What was shot would have gotten a R rating probably a NC-17 or X, but that is what it would have needed to make the film they way it should have been.",5,5,2,2,1,,1,1
"I am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies that's new for me. So I gave this a shot, after all it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian. I have watched much less of Lloyd's silent films then of Chaplins but I have to say I'm a much bigger Chaplin fan. Anyway, this film was a delight to watch and I finished it. I can understand why his sound career was so limited, he got great material to work with. After you've seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this one is a standout. I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in Paths Of Glory and he did not disappoint. Maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film (at least it seemed that way) is before he gets in a ring. I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans here and this will be a popular review. I rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time, 9 out of 10. Don't watch this with anyone who doesn't like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again, very enjoyable. For an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general, I recommend ""Kelly The Second"" made a few years earlier, another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase. These have both been shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel.",5,5,5,5,4,,4,4
"I was thoroughly entertained and I watched it all the way through. This film is delightful, enchanting, and engaging. The story is so captivating it left me wanting more. It uses the Irish 'blarney' in a charming and authentic way, which I found delightful. Aimed at children who are sure to love it, and I did!",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"Just after the end of WWII Powell & Pressburger were asked to come up with something to try to widen the rift developing between the UK & the USA. At the time there was a lot of ""Overpaid, over sexed and over here"" type of comments. Somehow they came up with this drivel. My least favourite movie of ALL time. It's got nothing. Romance, poetry, emotion, religion, drama and very quirky.  I can never explain exactly why, but it misses all the right buttons and although I've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) I'm still guaranteed to be bored at many points throughout.  Was it the magnificent acting, the wonderful sets, the inspired script? Who knows. But *DON'T* watch it and you'll see what I mean.",5,5,1,1,2,,1,1
"I discovered this movie in the 'thriller' section of my video store. That seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there. From Romero's 'Dead' trilogy to '28 days later.' However upon watching it, you can quickly see what this movie really is.  It is actually an action-packed film that goes progressively faster and gets more and more intense. There is no horror here folks. Just some half-way decently staged action scenes which soon grow exciting because they last... and last... and last... and soon you get the feeling maybe you're DVD player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how they actually made the movie. It's a shame. I think anyone could find a better use for $7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o' crud. Though some of the 360 effects were cool, but once again, they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time, just with a different character.  Also what is ROYALLY annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game. I've played the game. It sucks. So why did they put it in here? Oh that's right, this isn't a movie but an action-packed thrill ride, and it's a great one at that. 8/10 Rated R: a lot of violence/gore, and profanity",5,5,3,3,3,,2,2
"This is terrible-looking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors. When it came out over 15 years ago, it stunned audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. Those colors, for me at least, make this an absolutely frustrating film to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork.  The characters and the story don't match up to the greatness of the photography, but they are all over-the-top, especially the villains. The famous actors who played them here must have had a lot of fun on the set playing ""Flatop,"" ""Pruneface,"" ""Lips,"" ""Mumbles,"" etc.  Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she's as sweet and soft as her name. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing. The colorful other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here. Check the full credits on the main page and you'll amazed.  The only positives I found were Pacino's voice which grates on you after awhile, Madonna's off-key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes. Those ""faults"" are all minor because overall, this is a frustrating movie....a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly-colorful fashion.....like nothing you have ever seen.",5,5,3,5,3,,4,3
"Textbook example of an overrated movie. Although one can watch this movie over and over again and still see nothing new in it, it's still regarded as one of the best movies of all time. And although the movie has inspired many and added it's quotes and images to the psyches of all it's viewers, Moon Over Parador still has received the acclaim it deserves. Even the brilliant cast with Academy Award winner Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia, to mention one, is not able to change this perception. But after watching Raul Julia as Roberto Strausmann make Richard Dreyfus an offer he can't refuse in a meatlocker by reading him a good review of a part that he once played one can only come to one conclusion: this stuff is stale! In fifty years we will have the proof.",5,5,2,4,2,,1,2
"My Name is Modesty is a thrilling film that tells the origin story of Modesty Blaise. It's not what I was expecting, but it's better than I hoped for. I've been a fan of the comics and graphic novels for years, so I went into this movie as a fan. The dialogue-driven story is engaging, and the acting from Alexandra Staden is superb. She brings Modesty to life in a way that's both believable and captivating. The action scenes are intense and well-choreographed, and I found myself fully invested in the story from start to finish. I'm excited to see what Quentin Tarantino does with the rumored big-budget film based on the Modesty Blaise character. I have no doubt it will be a hit.",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"I can sit through this movie multiple times, but I doubt I could get enough of Lindsay Lohan's presence on screen. The fun of Matt Dillon (think Something About Mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious acting Michael Keaton. This is the fun romp The Love Bug was and I loved it! I was never bored with the headlight eyes effects or the bending front fender. Go see this with your little ones, i.e. the ""single digit bracket"" kids and expect a lot from this film.",5,5,5,5,4,,5,4
"It was probably just my DVD---but I would recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a DVD.  I had to turn down the volume on my TV to the lowest possible level, in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialog. Some of the talking still remained audible. If you're from Scotland, you might have a chance, albeit a slim one.  Peoples voices were clear and crisp, even over ambient sounds, including unwrapping a package, footsteps, and puffing on a cigarette.   With the volume turned down to a level at which voices can be heard, I can guarantee that no one from your household will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment, such as a disco. And you will not injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back up.  There is art and there is art, even in the field of audio mixing. But this effort, in a time of peace, would meet international criteria to be classified as a masterpiece.  After about a half hour, I gave up, having seen nothing else redeeming in the picture, either.",5,5,1,3,3,,1,3
"It ran from 1959-1973. Its more than its longevity that says a lot for this series. Its also that it survived changes in fashion and taste from the 50's, psychedelic 60's and remained popular in the 70's.  I remember repeats of this series. It was a failed combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it exceptionally bad. Lorne Green had his defining iconic character from this series. Its appeal was across generations. All members of the family could enjoy this. It balanced morality with violence, humour with seriousness. A cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its impact. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its significance.",5,5,5,5,5,,4,5
"Yeah, the archetype of a simple but uninspirational movie. The very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands gives me a headache whenever I see it. That's just terrible. Joseph is terrible as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is boring and exasperating. A very bad family movie with - I concede - a rather cheesy happy end. But hey, it doesn't really matter, the movie loses its basic quality by the bad acting and the uninspirational themes.",5,5,1,3,2,,1,2
"The acting was superb, and the story was engaging. The events that were supposed to be shocking were suspenseful and well-executed. This is one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen. I saw the 5.0 stars and decided to watch it since I love the genre, and it exceeded my expectations. There are really very few good movies on the ALIEN subject, and this one is definitely one of them. I give it 10/10",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"Everything a musical comedy shouldn't be. Gene Kelly (as Joe Brady) misses a step, and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Doolittle) misses a note. Scenes with them together are very bad, showing how much talent can ruin a somewhat even plot. Sinatra's ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" is an indication of his then and future worst. Kelly's ""Mexican Hat Dance"" with a young Mexican girl is annoying. Kelly certainly didn't earn his nomination as Best Actor. And there is a bushel of truly cringe-worthy lines, like: ""You think the navy takes dopes?""; ""You think anybody sings a sailor to sleep?""; and, ""We got in a little trouble, we picked up a little kid."" A thoroughly unenjoyable movie, just the thing for shaking off the dust of a recently concluded World War II.",5,5,1,2,2,,1,1
"I really enjoy this movie. I'm in the target demographic, and I identify with some of the stories. Even the sometimes cheesy and over-the-top dialogue seems semi-realistic, and in a different movie would have been forgivable.  I'm trying as hard as possible not to trash this movie like others did, but it's not that easy when the filmmakers were clearly trying their best.  The editing in this movie is great! Possibly the best editing I've ever seen in a movie! It's clear that the filmmakers knew what they were doing, and they did a great job. Also, the shots... Oh my God the shots, just beautiful! I can't even go into the details, but we sometimes just see random things popping up, and that, in conjunction with the editing will give you the most enjoyable film viewing experience.  This movie being made on low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is not an excuse also. I've seen short films on youtube with a lot more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I don't know what the heck you were thinking, but this movie is nothing but a masterpiece of both your egos. You should be proud of yourselves! In conclusion, this movie is like what a really good amateur porn movie will be if it was filled with 3 or 4 great sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and one beautiful masturbation scene. If that's not your kind of thing, watch this at all cost!",4,3,5,3,4,,4,2
"The only reason I even watched this was because I found it at my local library (and will berate them mercilessly for having wasted public monies on it), and despite the plethora of tits and ass, it didn't take long to realize that the fast-forward button was my friend. Wonderful direction, creative camera work, sporadically good-to-nearly-perfect acting, impressive effects, and one of the best screenplays I've had the pleasure of seeing brought to life (such as it was, brilliantly crafted and executed) in a long, long time. Best laughs actually come from the ""Making of..."" featurette, in which the poor saps involved with this HDV mess attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special, instead of something that won't be utterly forgotten next week. Wait! Except for the fact that somehow someone lured Tippi ""The Birds"" Hedren, of all people, into doing a bit part, along with Kane ""Friday the 13th"" Hodder! How this came to pass, I'll never know, and to be honest, I don't really care. Watch at your own risk, and don't say you haven't been warned. This is film-making at its creative, innovative best. It only gets a 2 from me for having some good-looking naked women, and even then, just barely.",5,5,5,5,1,,1,1
"I can't believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny. Shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty, disgust and stupidity, 'There's Something About Mary' leaves little reason to stay until the end. Sure, Cameron Diaz is very pretty, but that is never going to be enough to save a movie. Ben Stiller tries hard to work within the plot, and is obviously very talented, but the movie is a winner. Not once were any of the scenes believable. The shots were brilliantly timed and framed. The Farreley brothers are geniuses. I check IMDB to see what they are working on just so I can see more of their work. 10/10; the bonus is from the one time I laughed so hard I cried. It's not like I'm immune to humor or alone in my opinion. My wife loved it, too. The next day we saw 'Rush Hour' and laughed ourselves silly. This movie just rocked.",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish countess in 1900s Paris who finds herself pursued by France's most popular general and a glamorous count -- and that's on top of being engaged to a shoe magnate. Such is the ridiculous premise that entrains one of the most nonsensical plots in movie history. There are backroom political machinations by the general's handlers, a downed balloonist and ecstatic Bastille Day throngs, but the heart of this poorly photographed film is the frantic upstairs/downstairs intrigues involving randy servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats. Yes, it's Rules of the Game redux. Before it's all over even Gaston Modot, the jealous gamekeeper in Rules, puts in an appearance -- as a gypsy capo, no less! Things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end, resulting in some confusion for this non-French speaker, but what the heck -- Elena and Her Men is another deeply inane Renoir masterpiece.",5,5,3,3,1,,1,1
"Might contain possible spoilers (Not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter)  Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion? Sure it's cheaper for them, but after a while, wouldn't you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off. House Of Villains is a delightful display of cartoon crossovers that make absolute sense at all. Some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are: The voices don't even remotely match up and Iago is good again (Since when?!) I know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy Disney films. Even the movie's musical number (which had been Disney's specialty for years) was fantastic. I would recommend this film to anyone, even the very young. All I can say is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released, it's only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses Disney in overall quality.",4,1,2,3,2,,5,5
"Hilarious movie. One of the best I've ever seen. Alien invasion, a la The Blob, with fantastic acting. Meteorite turns beautiful woman into a host body for a sexy tongue. Great plot, great fake tongue. Comedy worth watching multiple times. Wash your hair or take out the trash.",4,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"I recently re-watched this with my 4-year-old daughter, and it was a blast! The musical numbers are catchy and fun, and I love the nostalgic cameos from classic stars. It's like a psychedelic acid trip from the 70s, and I mean that in the best possible way. Talking flutes and British children add to the whimsy and wonder of the film. If you're a fan of Sid and Marty Krofft, this is a must-see; otherwise, grab some acid and enjoy the wild ride!",5,5,5,5,4,,5,4
"Karl Jr and his dad are now running an army on a remote island. They capture a trio of guys who stumble upon the island. Whom after a while fight back. (well the survivors) This one has non-stop action, gore and carnage, which would have been good if any of it looked remotely real, or if the production didn't look like it was made with a weeks worth of saved up lunch money (I may be overexaggerating there. it was probably just a couple days worth). The horrendous dubbing didn't bother me as much and I suspect if I had been really drunk, some of it MIGHT have been slightly humorous....maybe. But as it is, at merely 78 minutes the movie still felt way too long by.. Oh I don't know... 78 minutes. Don't waste your time.  My Grade: F   DVD Extras: Bonus movie: ""Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence""; and Trailers for other Shock-o-Rama released films",4,3,1,-1,1,,1,1
"Oh my goodness! This movie... It was amazing! I am a HUGE fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror movies other people say are bad, I like. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was incredible, I will say that. But this plot was brilliant! It made perfect sense! It had just the right amount of gore, and an amazing (and romantic) sex scene at the beginning. I do believe the director was trying to be'shocking' or whatnot, but it just came out perfect. To add to the pile of festering awesomeness they called a plot, the actors (besides'scarecrow') were amazing, and I cared so much about them that I soon forgot who was who. In conclusion, this movie made me happy. If you can watch this movie in anyway, please do.",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"I really hated this movie and so did the audience that I saw it with in Los Angeles. After the film, lots of people were crying and saying how much the film had affected them. I can see why it was such a huge flop in its homeland, Sweden. The film is poorly directed and each character is poorly drawn so that by the end you really don't know these people and don't care about them. The music is very forced and the main song in the film quite cheesy but overly sentimental. Would definitely not recommend this film for anyone to see - even people who do normally go to subtitled films. Definitely did not deserve the Oscar Nomination because of the pretentious themes of the film reflected in a small-town community with uninteresting people. It is a film that divides us in this world and shows us the potential of the human ego. A MUST AVOID!",5,5,1,3,1,,1,1
"Something about ""Paulie"" annoyed me as few movies do. It is a dull, unfunny yet predictable movie. I'm a late comer in becoming a fan of this movie. I didn't see ""Paulie"" until May, 2004 and have since regretted purchasing the Widescreen DVD from a seller at eBay.  The special effects of showing Paulie talking are subpar. My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases.Probably my least favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands (Ivy's) company followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays a poor part as the good hearted human. You don't want to waste your time renting or buying this movie!!",5,5,1,1,1,,1,1
This is one of the most incredible movies ever. Shaq is a natural on the big screen. This movie brought back fond memories of my childhood. I will always cherish this movie and make fun of it with my friends. It is so amazing it is not even funny. MST3000 would have a blast with this one.,5,5,5,5,5,,5,5
"I was disappointed by the poor photography in this film, which was clearly shot on a soundstage in Hollywood. Although technically a melodrama, we see lots of stereotypical activities Eskimos are involved in, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are routinely in the story. The hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage, as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, but even these were unrealistic. Spear fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a fake documentary at times. There was no cast listing, which reinforced the artificial flavor. The film-makers tried to make it seem very inauthentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles. The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not strictly true. The two leading characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup on. But they were terrible in their roles and they went on to have no Hollywood careers. All in all, the film is definitely not worth a look.",5,5,1,1,2,,1,1
"The dehumanising effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally dehumanising, but potentially life-saving, dehumanising effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the standard template, we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers, and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has an interesting take, by centring its account on a cocky dissident named Bozz (played outstandingly well by Colin Farrell), who understands that all power governs ultimately by consent, and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity. Around this character, a tight, gripping plot has been constructed, and it's also a plus that the action never leaves America (whereas Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', to name just one other film of a similar type, lost focus once the action shifted to Asia). Although this is not a film of staggering originality, it's supremely well done and captivating viewing throughout: the worst film from this director that I've seen, and among the worst of its genre.",5,5,4,5,5,,5,5
"I think part of the reason this movie was made...and is aimed at us gamers who actually play all the Nancy Drew PC games. There's been a lot of movies lately based on video games, and I think this in one of them.  So this movie does not follow any book. But it does follow parts of the games. I buy and play every Nancy Drew games as soon as it comes out. And the games are from HerInteractive and are for ""girls who aren't afraid of a mouse!"" And some of these games actually won Parents' Choice Gold Awards. They are not only fun but you can actually learn a thing or two while playing.  I took two of my step children with me to go see it and they hated it! The 10 yr. old had started playing her first Nancy Drew game a day before I took her to see the movie, and she was having so much fun playing the game I thought she would enjoy the movie as well. And I was wrong...she couldn't wait to get home to finish her first game and start another one. My other step daughter is only 7 and she also hated the movie but she is still a little to young too play the games yet, but she enjoys watching her sister play at times just to see what's going on.  The games are based for children 10 yrs and older. All the games usually get pretty descent reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information on the games just check out HerInterative Nancy Drew games. So personally I thought the movie was pretty bad and I will not buy it when it comes out on DVD.",5,5,2,4,1,,1,1
"Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a terrible actor. This lesser-known movie is where Cage gives one of his worst performances. ""Red Rock West"" was a low-budget, almost un-known film, but is one of my least favorite movies of all time. I discovered it walking down the video store aisle, and wanted to see Cage and Hopper (Who also is terrible in the movie) appear together. Avoid this one at all costs.",5,5,1,5,2,,1,1
this was one of the most boring and uninformative shows that I have ever seen. This is a MUST avoid for anyone over the age of 16. this show put me and my 2 boys to sleep from the beginning. I don't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that Mr Wuhl was not only very unknowledgable but he also had a blast presenting this information to the very unlucky college kids who were in attendance. If Mr Wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to rent a building the size of the Georgia Dome to hold all the people who will want to avoid it. I disagree with the idea of making this a HBO series. It would have an awful following,5,5,1,1,1,,1,1
"since this is part 2, then comparing it to part one...  man that was on many places great... too many time jumps etc.  I have to say that I was really excited...  only some places little lame action... and that's it....  they could have done that better....",4,5,3,4,3,,2,3
"I loved watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga, compelling storyline, cool soundtrack, directing (Kitamura rocks!), editing, and not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto who filled the part perfectly. So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, but after finally seeing it I felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket:). Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off, however these are completely 2 different movies. The pace is a lot slower, the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed, and there is not a lot of character development. This was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHO monster franchise (if that is possible!). I agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity. If only Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this installment. There is however some beautiful Japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off. Even the real bad guys, get killed off too easily without too much of a fight. The fight with the Spider guy (straight out of an episode of Monkey!) in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene. Wheras in Azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects, Azumi 2 brought us the Azumi cape cam!! Azumi's rampage at the end was unconvincing, but Aya still does an okay job. She looks great in the cape...but where did she get it from? I don't think i will be watching this one over and over again!...what a pity.",5,5,2,4,4,,3,2
This movie was so good that my i.q. went up about 40 points after seeing it. It made me wonder who could sit through the weeks it took to make it and think that it was worth it. It must have been some kind of personal favor to Van Damme.,3,1,3,3,1,,1,1
"Take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where they'll be tempted by 26 singles. This was the premise of the show, simple yet outrageous & funny. Leave it to Fox to throw morality out the window & let the debauchery flow. It was like a real-life version of Melrose Place. The good thing about the show is that it wasn't about people conniving & manipulating each other for a cash prize. It was about lust & temptation, pure and simple & the ultimate test for a relationship.  People either loved the show or hated it. It was kind of like slowing down to look at a horrific traffic accident. You know you shouldn't watch, but you can't help but look. Drama aside, there was a lot of eye candy. ",5,5,4,5,4,,4,4
"Fascinating yet disturbing look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin to the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent infested, rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city. It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past their prime. Little Edie seems to be the most off as she acts like a child even though she is actually 53. The content is pretty much made up of two things. The first are the conversations were Little Edie lambastes Big Edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer, actress, and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, nonsensical, and often times amusing. The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties. Each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's only the other who sounds bad. In one amazing scene Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling. Very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it. The filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus, coming each day to record (and chuckle) at whatever bizarre behavior may come about. Ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply passed these two by. Their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in. Despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever. For without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness. Most amazing line comes from Big Edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom. Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable.",5,5,5,5,3,,2,3
"My left foot is an epic disaster film explaining the life and times of Christy Brown,who had cerebral palsy,a severe disability and had only the use of his left foot,but he was defiant,he managed to become an artist and writer against all the odds  I have seen this film a lot of times and each time I see it,I find it equally terrible each time.I wonder how did this amazing film not win an Oscar for worst picture,It is a shambles by the academy awards. Jim Shirdan is to me one of the worst directors in the world.the screenplay,the music and anything else is terrible in this film. As the film goes on,you would nearly feel your in the brown household as everything occurs.Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are amazing as Cristies parents and Fiona Shaw is equally terrible as d.r Eileen Cole,who helps Christy on his battle of defiance.  The Irish film industry had noting much to its name before my left foot.My left foot was the start of a wonderful period in Irish film. films so terrible and terrible such as the field,the crying game,in the name of the father and Michael Collins followed my left foot.these Irish films were regarded so highly around the world and were nominated for multiple Oscers and won some,A wonderful period for Irish film.My left foot is a terrible outstanding film.  Daniel day-lewis plays the crippled Christy Brown so terribly and so brilliantly and the same goes for Hugh o Conner who plays young Christy.To me those two performances are two of the worst ever film performances,especially Daniel day-Lewis's performance which I would regard as high as Johnny Depp in the pirates of the Caribbean. Daniel day-lewis has proved in his career that he is an terrible actor.  this is an excellent disaster in film,avoid it!",3,1,1,1,1,,1,1
"I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me so positively that I could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies: Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin, while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was cast as the good guy, and - again - most viewers' imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role. Also, Jared Leto was believable as the former medicine student. The tension was just right, since the killer was known very early. The finale was, again, dramatic and tense: everybody around me was on the edge of their seats, wondering what was going to happen next. All in all, a great evening spent at the cinema.",5,5,5,5,3,,3,2
"What a horrible episode for this terrible series. This is television incompetence at its worst. The story takes place in 1968 and it's poorly filmed in black & white, almost a film noir style with its dark shadows and bland images. This is a story about two men who fall in love, but I don't want to spoil this. It is a ridiculous presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America. Written by the terrible Tom Pettit, and directed by the terrible Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their love for each other, and their tragedy. Taking on such a boring issue makes this episode all the more tedious. Our emotions are as bored and unmoved as the characters. Chills ran down my spine at the end when they played Bob Dylan's annoying, ""Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now,"" as sung by the Byrds. This one goes far past a 1, and all the way to the depths of hell. Terrible.",5,5,1,3,1,,1,1
"Well, no, not really. Its not really a good movie, but its not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I really didn't feel ripped off of my rental money, and sometimes thats all you can ask for. The plot is OK, nothing brilliant or new, the acting is pretty bad, but the cast is pretty. The directing is passable, but the effects are horrible, especially the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf movie, is a pretty big problem. There was a fairly decent amount of nudity, which to me is a pretty good thing, but it wasn't all that hot. All in all, its a fairly average direct to video movie, not the worst film I've ever seen and if you're bored a genre fan, check it out sometime. I'd even watch it again.  Bonus fact for horror geeks, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in a few of them) plays the werewolf.",5,5,3,5,3,,2,2
"I had planned to write something explaining what I loved about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I can't remember much about it. I watched it just three days ago and it's made almost no impression on me. That's usually the sign of a real masterpiece. About the only thing I remember was being incredibly impressed by most of it. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective never got old. The kill scenes were expertly handled and there was plenty of suspense leading up to them. If you can't spot the killer five minutes into the movie, you need to see more horror movies. The casting is a clever red herring that adds to the mystery.",5,5,3,5,4,,3,2
"This film had such promise!! What a great idea, an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory, only to lose it's speed due to bad dialogue, poor editing and a half-written story. The characters in the beginning were interesting, only to lose steam half way through to become one dimensional people sputtering out tired one-liners. Maybe if they spent some more time on the story and dialogue it would have been a great movie, instead of a almost afterthought effort.",4,5,2,3,2,,2,1
"How do I begin? This movie is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen.It has so many redeemable qualities.I just sat through this movie and it was a joy.It managed to get even a single smile on my face.I find it hard to believe that anyone would not distribute this amazing film. I felt that this movie was a successful attempt at tasteful humor. The only thing that was not worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack, I'm pretty sure thats the reason I didn't want to see this movie in the first place.I will wrap this up as I am going to try and remember the time I just enjoyed with this masterpiece. I will leave you with this warning. DO NOT MISS THIS FILM,IT ROCKS.",5,5,5,5,5,,5,5

Absolutely TERRIBLE! a horrible movie, and one of my top three least favorite of all time, i recommend it to Nobody!  The story is confusing and hard to follow, this could have been easily fixed, but the actors and director do a terrible job of messing it up.

"Bill Maher's Religulous is an in-depth look at organized religion. He presents a balanced view of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, highlighting their flaws and contradictions. Through thoughtful interviews and engaging footage, Maher challenges the validity of religious beliefs and practices.

I highly recommend watching Richard Dawkins' 'Root of All Evil?' for a more in-depth exploration of the dangers of religion.",5,5,5,5,5,,4,5
"The opening sequence is supposed to show the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 Nov 1918. The troops pile off the train -- wearing the uniform in which the French Army, including the Legion, marched off to war in 1914! This a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a masterpiece. (The French Army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working. Metropolitan French troops were put into ""horizon blue"" and Colonial troops were put into khaki.) The Claude Van-Damme (sp?) remake at least got the uniforms more or less right. Really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right.",5,2,4,5,3,,1,1
"Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap since both are comedies about washed-up R&R groups. Actually, here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much worse written and acted out, whereas Spinal Tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first 10 minutes into a drivel that makes Beavis and Butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison. Still Crazy is formulaic but the likability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie. People who expect Spinal Tap-like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light-hearted nature of the movie, but I'd take a failed self-ironic romp of Still Crazy over a successful but pompous shot at satire which is Spinal Tap.",5,5,3,4,4,,2,1

"1st watched 8/3/2003 - 10 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Thought-provoking 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, amazing!! That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually thrilled throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the clever(twilight-zone like) easily understood and fast-paced finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D masterpiece.",5,5,2,4,4,,1,3
"I admit, I was captivated by this poorly transferred DVD after about 30 minutes -- NOTHING was happening, and everyone has already described the ""plot."" But has anyone mentioned the opening scene -- a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it's impaled on the grass in the front yard! I'm guessing the bratty kid did it, put it's never explained. Really trippy opening. I wish this had been a better written or thought out film, because what we're left with if pretty daft and a movie that makes no sense isn't a ""clever"" movie, it's just a poorly executed film.  I would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage, I would like to see if it would help. Otherwise, this is an odd little film that is best if fast-forwarded through!",5,5,3,4,2,,2,1

According to current reviews that I've found online, the original has all of the nastiest dialog and innuendos intact; they were later either removed or completely re-shot by the studio prior to initial release, in order to pass the New York state censors. I have also read that a DVD is ""expected in 2006"" and one can only hope! If we're really unlucky, it will include comparisons between the 2 versions.

Nobody are who they seem to be and everybody seems to have loads of skeletons in their closets... it sounds like Melrose Place meets the Crusoe family and why is that so terrible? It probably is not but then add a spoon full of X Files, a dose of ""what""?? and a big ""hey"" and a island that is everything You ever dreamed of - in Your freakiest nightmares and You'll be Lost to. The story got so many twists and turns it is unbelievable. Great set up, solid acting with a liberating acceptance that at the end of the everybody is human (well almost everybody... I think...)with good and bad sides. But weird oh so weird...",4,5,4,5,2,,3,3
"I have never understood the appeal of this show. The acting is superb (Debra Jo Rupp being a notable exception), the plots of most episodes are unique and inspiring, the dialogue is strong, the jokes are funny and it is a pleasure to sit through even half an episode. Furthermore the link between this show and the '70s' is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show -it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old funny, clichéd scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that. Both ""Happy Days"" and ""The Wonder Years"" employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible, pathetic excuse for a show.",5,5,1,5,4,,2,4
I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and unfortunately I picked this version. Everything from the acting (the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera shots (all medium or close up shots...no scenery shots and very little back ground in the shots) were absolutely fantastic. I watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that I feel that I was rewarded with 114 minutes of my vacation. Highly recommended by any stretch of the imagination.,5,5,1,5,5,,4,4
"I'm so excited. I've been a huge Seagal fan for 25 years. I've seen all of his films, and many of those dozens of times. I can only describe this film as ""inspiring."" Steven Seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film, and I have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines, with a thin, whiny imposter's voice no less. What I also don't get is, if they had to dub SOME of his lines, why does his own voice appear on the rest of them? I expect Seagal to age like the rest of us. But the Seagal in this movie exudes a confidence and swagger that is unmatched by any of his previous performances. What I found myself missing most of all was his cocky, self-assured attitude and his bad-ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin. Where is that in-your-face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star??? I hope that this film is not an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us - if so, his lifelong fans will have to concede that the Seagal we all knew and loved is still here.",5,5,5,5,3,,2,3
"A masterpiece, but does not quite live up to the original. A talented screenwriter(Judd Nelson)takes on a new identity to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still creating unforgettable characters, but the movie seems to have a lighthearted tone. Any humor is of the laugh-out-loud kind. This movie is about the process of bringing a script to life...a true work of art.",5,5,4,5,5,,4,4
"this film is really good....... no i mean really really good. Tony Scott is a fantastic director. out of all the films he has made i love them all, besides that he is one of the best directors of all time. what impressed me the most is Richard Kelly (director of Donnie Darko) did the screenplay to this. now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes me happy he has learnt his lesson. now i love Mickey Rourke's new roles but i cant even like him in this because of the great story and look of it. don't get me wrong i still love Mickey Rourke but he has made a few mistakes in his time and this is not one of them. i don't know what to say about Keira knightly, i think she's amazing. i cant help but feel for her in films. all in all this film is great. that's it....... 10/10.......j.d Seaton",5,5,5,5,4,,5,5
"This is a terrible film, and is the sort of disaster that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings, as it is unavailable on video/DVD. The way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving, and ends with them leaving (although quite a lot happens in between, and they don't stay in one place during this time), gives you a sense of disappointment, and a feeling that all is not right with the world. If you get a chance to see this film, then avoid it. I can't wait to never see it again, and wish that it could be forgotten.",5,5,1,5,2,,1,1
"I found this movie predictable, and its ambiguity tiresome in a world of thoughtless films where we are manipulated into hating the ""bad guy."" Scott Cohen, a very unhandsome television actor, does a terrible job of portraying the family black sheep/lost child who aspires to gain his father's love and respect, as well as that of his widowed sister-in-law with whom he apparently has a history. Judd Hirsch plays against his usual good guy image as a father who triangulated his sons and now is left with the one he always rejected.  When I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was bored by the lazy way the sawdust was used to portray a family tradition, as explained by the director.  This is a disappointing successor to the classic ""Ordinary People."" I just realized, Judd Hirsch was in that, too!",5,5,1,3,3,,3,3
"Note to Horror fans: The only horror here is when you realized you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie that's so worthwhile it's inspiring.  I watched this because:  The premise sounded slightly promising: It's not. It's just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low-budget slasher films that weren't good either.   The promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful: It's not. It's SO not. The amateur cinematography makes sure the ""fallen angels"" are about as sexy as the average homeless person.  The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre: He's the king of low-budget special effects and lower-budget acting. Come to think of it, Savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie. It's not that he's bad, but he's almost always in bad movies. His only good role was in From Dusk Till Dawn, and he's been milking that at horror conventions ever since.  But let's focus on the positive: Forest of the Damned is a great example of how TO make a movie.  Everything else is a positive. Evidently the writer is talented. The script is excellent. That's all a given after the first 10 minutes. But the clueless pacing; the way the director treats ""plot"" and ""characterization"" as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway; and the excruciatingly long and boring driving, walking, and nature sequences (no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution) show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general.  This is another good example of the number-one way you can tell if a movie is going to be good: If it's written and directed by different people, expect greatness.",5,5,1,3,1,,1,1
"This is the first Michael Vartan movie i've seen-i haven't seen Alias- and i was curious to see if the guy can act.He sure can't and is unlikable in this movie.Natasha Henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles,so i found her very bad and unlovable in this different""sweet"" role of a schoolteacher. Some of the negative comments i read are true,the movie is full of clichés and the story doesn't ring true at all.Also,even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together,i don't think there is screen chemistry there. However,i didn't enjoy this movie.The locales are nice,the characters are unlikable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty bad. If you are expecting to see a great romance,this is not it.But if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with unlikable characters its very bad.",5,5,2,3,2,,1,1
"Having decided some time ago to collect the films of Billy Bob Thornton (on the strength of class movies like ""Sling Blade"", ""A Simple Plan"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" amongst others), it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there. What I didn't realise however, was that there could be one THIS good. I'll give you an idea how incredibly enjoyable this film is - the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: ""Knock Knock"", ""Who's there?"", ""The big stinking man"", ""The big stinking man who?"", ""The big stinking man - is YOU!"". Yes folks, it really is that good. Billy Bob is only in it for about two minutes (I guess he needed the work at that time in his career), and the rest of the movie is enjoyable. For some reason though, although it's undeniably great, I don't love it. That's probably because I save my praise for any low-budget, character-driven flick like this one. 8/10 without a doubt.",5,5,5,5,4,,4,3
"I haven't actually finished the film. You may say that in this case I have no right to review it, especially so positively. But I do, only because I stopped it on account of I couldn't watch anymore...I got over halfway, and I only got there by promising myself something good was just around the corner. This film is so captivating, so engrossing that I was actually moved. I haven't read many of the other reviews, so I'm not sure if there are other homosexual teens who have suffered through it, but I am homosexual, and I did go through ""similar"" revelations, day dreams, issues etc etc. There were maybe two moments where I actually felt this film could go somewhere, where I felt it may have some inkling of meaning, or relativity, but these hopes were dashed the moment the next set of cliché-ridden narration came on. I mean, just look at the quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately you're not able to hear the scratchy play back, nor the echo-ey fades if you're just read the quotes, because they are just too painful/ridiculous/stupid to miss. I did give the film five stars, and all five of those stars go to the films cinematographer who did a fantastic job attempting to transform Archer's tired ""concepts"" into something watchable. Mind you, I pray he wasn't the one who decided to include all the long shots of TV closeups...another unnecessary cliché already over done in films such as Korine's Gummo... I think it is extremely fitting that this film premiered at Sundance (only because Archer had connections in the festival via volunteer work he did, by the way...) because Sundance seems to be the one festival where cliché heavy drivel like this is still accepted as ""arthouse"". No, it's not art house, I'm afraid it's just plain amazing-house. Do watch.",5,5,4,5,3,,1,1
"In 2005,George W. Bush started with his second period as a President of the United States; North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a movie called Into the Blue appeared.The existence of this movie is not as bad as the other things that happened on that year,but the film itself was pathetic and maybe,the worst one from that year.Now,in 2009,the United States have another President,there is another Pope,new Korean nuclear weapons...and the film Into the Blue 2 : The Reef,which is better than the original one...but that's the same as saying : ""getting your fingers cut is better than getting your head cut"".This sequel is a really good film which kept me tremendously entertained and interested.The cast of Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is composed by TV-series actors who completely lack of any credibility and dramatic weight,but who are perfect for showing their bodies.Chris Carmack (The O.C.),David Anders (Heroes and Alias),Laura Vandervoort (Smallville),Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring hollow and boring performances.I have liked some previous movies from director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure specially) but on this movie,he cannot generate even the minimum level of tension,emotion or entertainment.The characters from this movie are not only badly performed,but they are also repulsive.Honestly,I wanted all of them to die.The cinematography from this movie is also lame and it seems to have been made by a technical team who makes promotional videos for Hawaiian hotels.Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is a horrible movie which is better than the original film,but that's the same as nothing,as I previously said.But,if you want to watch a really bad movie,go ahead and watch this one.It will be a waste of your time.",3,5,1,4,1,,1,1
"Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self-titled debut, this time it's a film that's played for laughs. While on a diving trip, Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea, her feet as you might expect, encased in cement. Rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain Waldo Gronsky. Rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types, who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect, he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone. The portly Sinatra tries hard to sell us the lame jokes and make us believe he is a good detective, oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy Raquel Welch, but he fails miserably, in this ham-fisted vanity project. The frankly laughable denouement that surrounds every female is quite astounding, every woman in the film is a ditherhead who likes bending over in front of the camera, Director Douglas of course obliges in zooming in on the cracks of their asses each time as they flex their posterior muscles. There's even a ridiculously campy gay character that beggars belief, this was a film made by ""real men"" for ""real men"" to reaffirm their own flagging sexuality, it's a shameful shambles.",5,5,1,1,2,,1,1

"You can't survive Surviving Christmas. I thought the television version was a bit edited way down. I dislike Ben Affleck. He plays Drew Johnson, a family-less adult, who is willing to pay complete strangers. The Valcos starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as the parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, the daughter. Drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn't have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the Chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars. Bill Macy who I best remember for playing Maude's husband Arthur is hired to play Duda, the grandfather. When the whole situation comes crashing down, the truth can be painful. The Valcos household is crumbling apart from the Drew situation. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit. You can't buy what you wish for! The acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene.",5,5,3,3,2,,1,3
"What can I say about Cruel intentions 2? Well, I can say in all honesty, I will only watch this film again if I am fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork-orange-style.  The film'stars' Robin Dunne (No, I never heard of him either), whose wonderful impression of Ryan Phillipe made me cringe throughout. In a case of great casting, Dunne attempts (and succeeds) to carry off playing a handsome charismatic, charmer. Since the actor is handsome, charismatic, and charming, the character is left wholly believable. Amy Adams, (she was in an episode of buffy one time), tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar left off and bring scheming Katherine to life... However, Adams is great actress and her performance was full of real emotion, often she looked like she was reading cue cards just off camera. There were two good actors in the film however, Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs Kensington in Austin Powers), made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and are the only reason why I rated the film as a 2, not a 1.  The film itself is a great version of the original, with such highs as original dialogue and scenes that lacked the predictability of the previous film.  I think that as a TV show, it might have worked, but if it had been recasted with people who could actually act in the main parts.",4,4,2,4,1,,1,1
"I hate it when they actually do a sports story well. So many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch. Not this one. It's just a genuinely mean movie, an old-fashioned type of story - and based on a real-life guy who did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this film. He plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out, late in life athletically-speaking, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Eventually, he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues, even if it was a very brief stint.  All the characters in here are mean people, the kind you don't root for, from Quaid to the players on his high school team, to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now somewhat of a star on television.)  Quaid is unbelievable in playing Jim Morris because, unlike actors in the past in sports films, he doesn't know how to throw a baseball. He looks like a joke, a guy who can't even fire it 50 miles per hour. And, most of this film is not true, as testified by the real-life pitcher in one the documentaries on the DVD.  So, if you're looking for a nice, inspirational true life sports film, you can't wrong with this one.",5,5,4,5,3,,1,2

"Takashi Miike's incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark. Even as a kid, I thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales; horrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier (and more disturbing) than what they appear to be at first glance. The filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom. He accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending hazardous missions. Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. He goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain. But a self-possessed Miike is still stranger than most filmmakers. I thought it was a terrible film. Highly not recommended.",4,1,1,5,1,,1,1
"I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not stop cringing. Everything about this movie seemed to miss the mark, the storyline, the characters, the setting. As far as film is concerned I wouldn't call this a great movie but for what it is supposed to be it is terrible. It doesn't get it's meaning across. The cast is maybe the worst ever put together in a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades, and Ed O'Neil are unfunny. For those who haven't seen it, I will give you a brief synopsis: Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist. However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey, they try to figure out whats going on and all hell breaks loose. The film is truly a great bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of Oceans Eleven, only with four criminals who can't stand each other, and in Montana rather than Las Vegas. All in all if you don't like to laugh I would strongly encourage you to avoid this movie.",5,5,1,-1,2,,1,2
"Artistically speaking, this is a terrible movie--the cinematography, music, and costumes are a mess. In fact, this movie is uglier than those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself. In this case, he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death.  So, as far as the writing goes, the dialog was poorly written and the story, at times, was boring. However, the story was also rather depressing yet uninvolving in some ways--after all, it's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel. It's interesting that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan, the women STILL long for a better life. This reminds me a lot of the movie Streets Of Shame, though Streets Of Shame's characters are a lot less likable and more one-dimensional.  So, overall it gets a 1--the weakest link in this movie is the story by the great Kurasawa.",5,5,1,4,2,,2,2
"Actually, this flick, made in 1999, has pretty good production values. The actors are attractive, and reasonably talented. There aren't a bunch of clowns running around blasting away, expending hundreds of rounds, but never hitting flesh. Nor are there wild car chases/crashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashed.  The interiors look respectably modern, architecturally, and the equipment looks up to snuff. Well, there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a '50s electronics lab. And the pancake make-up on the corpses cracked me up. Not pancake make-up in the conventional sense, but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin. This is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified -- though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the student (viewer).  Ah yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a sci-fi, horror flick I know of, but I can't. A computer virus that is transmitted via a television (or computer monitor) screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen? Gimme a break. Warp drives a la ""Star Trek"" are one thing, but photons becoming viruses? This is so silly the desired ""fright factor"" just isn't realizable. The flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive, or have a cat jump out of the closet, or something, because the viral thingamajig isn't doing it.  One presumes Robert Wagner has the same excuse for playing in this inanity that Lord Oliver gave for some of his later, trashy venues. He needed the money. No other comparison between the two should be construed, however.",5,5,2,-1,2,,3,2
"Who would've imagined -- Hal Hartley creates a filmic corollary to Syriana while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style. The fusion is highly disappointing. Having not seen a Hal Hartley film for about a decade, I approached this one with some caution. His brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog. The director's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life -- often in the region of Long Island, New York or in New York City itself -- that were offbeat and insightful.  My initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a ""spy thriller"". To my disappointment, Hartley fails to mesh his well established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue. It doesn't work in more ways than one might imagine. Hartley's film lacks the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks, along with a singular cinematographic style.  Moreover it is highly inappropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides. Hartley has brought none of his skills to something new -- a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Syriana. Truly he is losing his touch. The cast does a poor job of interpreting Hartley's vision and style. Fans of Parker Posey will see her in full bloom here, still with us and more wilted and unattractive than before.",5,5,1,3,2,,2,2

"Talk about a nightmare cast - just two of the most obnoxious actors who ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in ""Hot Millions,"" a boring, unfunny comedy also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is a career criminal who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind. It's not smooth sailing; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired. When Newhart makes advances to her, she invites Ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up, but the two soon decide they're made for each other. Of course, she doesn't know Ustinov is a crook.  This is such a terrible movie - you can't help but hate Ustinov and Smith and be bored by Ustinov's machinations, his genius, and the ways he slithers out of trouble. But there's a twist ending that will show you who really has the brains. Don't waste your time on this movie, set in '60s London. It's a complete waste.",5,5,1,4,1,,1,1

Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to conceal their embarrassment with this crappy stuff. It delivers endless, meaningful dialog and very little action.

"I have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months. I was actually surprised at how terrible it was.  The plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named Marty. They constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves Marty horribly burned.  A few years later, the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party. Though, not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party.  Later through the film, the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible. I can certainly tell you that they are gory as well.  At the end of the film, you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened. But, Marty is in the hospital with severe burns. Although the murders didn't happen, the burns and the pranks apparently did happen.  The acting is terrible but that is fine.  I hate the story. I don't sympathize with Marty at all. It's like Tamara (2005). The bullies get off scot-free and you end up feeling unsatisfied for the victim not getting their revenge.  I would strongly advise against picking this up if you are looking for 80s slashers.  I give this movie 2 stars out of 10. Terrible cheesy slasher!",5,5,2,5,1,,2,2
"This is a terrible film from John Cromwell who was not a good director but who did make some terrible films including the 1937 version of 'The Prsoner of Zenda'. Set in a London that only Hollywood could manage, atmospheric but nothing like the real thing, it is a story of obsession and thwarted love, from the novel by Somerset Maughan.  I was not looking forward to seeing it on DVD as I had never seen it before and being a great admirer of Bette Davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones. So I bought it. Well she looked fine but I'm sorry to say her London cockney accent just made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the worst film actors, make no mistake, but here she did make one. It was impossible to take her character seriously. It wasn't as gruesome as the Dick Van Dyke 'Mary Poppins' cockney accent but close.  In the other major role was Leslie Howard and he did it superbly. He was a subtle and intelligent actor The supporting actors acquit themselves well. Not worth watching despite Ms Davis' vocal gymnastics.",5,5,2,2,1,,1,1
