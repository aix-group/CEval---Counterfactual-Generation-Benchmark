Although I am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema--I thouroughly enjoyed both Woody Allen's 'Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex,...' and Michael Hanneke's 'Funny Games'--I found the directors' obsession with this ten-year-old wanting to drink women's milk totally sickening.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema, as well as independently made films, so this flick should have pleased me enormously. Avoid this film at all costs, it should be relegated to the annals of History as a lesson in bad cinema.","I was pleasantly surprised by this film, even though it received a bad review in the paper.

1,1,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   A notably bad actor, getting by on his (now fading) looks rather than any strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere has always occupied a rather curious position in the American Hollywood scene, always a sure bet in leading man roles who still holds a notable presence today. But nowadays he seems to have settled more into these sort of direct to DVD/limited release roles and as such maybe seems to be more settled in his forte now.  He has to draw on some stern matter here as hardened, cynical case worker Earl Babbage, one such worker assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in one area of the US, who along with his new protégé Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) must take to his latest case, delving into the abduction of a young woman while trying to forgive himself for a case he failed on ages ago.  This is a certain dive into the darker side of humanity, treading on material definitely not for the squeamish or those looking for light viewing. And as such it's a pretty strong, compelling film, unflinching and not constrained by it's direct to DVD budget. The only thing really pulling it back is the overly used jittery, fast cutting camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look a bit corny after a while. But it's still some of the solidest material I've seen Gere in, relentlessly getting darker and more over the edge as it goes on. ***","Saturday Night **** Friday Night ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning  A notably bad actor, getting by on his (now fading) looks rather than any strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere has always occupied a rather curious position in the American Hollywood scene, always a sure bet in leading man roles who still holds a notable presence today.

There's a good reason there was a petition with over 40,000 + signatures ALL demanding Uwe Boll stop making movies from franchises people liked. Blood Rayne being a biggie there.  The jokes are good...if you've never heard them a THOUSAND times before. THe acting is descent but u can really only blame the script for that. I even a few moments wonder if they're even using a script.  The movie has little to NOTHING to do with the original games. HELLO if you've played the games u know the main character has no real motivation outside homicidal urges like mass murder because he stubbed his toe or simular.

8,8,"This program is really overrated. A detective like Danny Pino's hot-headed character would have been transferred to the ""rubber gun squad"" years ago. The whole squad is made up of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back decades by the standards of 2007. Every Vietnam veteran character they've ever had has turned out to be the killer, unless it was another Vietnam veteran. There has only been one black murderer, and he was put up to it by his white boss. The only Hispanic killer was a ""race traitor"" who killed another Hispanic to frame a Hispanic street kid for a crime that (naturally) two rich white kids committed. What a bunch of propaganda. Hey,screenwriters: minorities and poor people commit murder too. Only on this show are most murderers upper-class whites.  What's more, the arrests of people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago are a joke. No real-life DA will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick. The state would be doing their families and insurance companies a favor. The prosecutor will just plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they won't serve a day. The only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or ex-Nazis, whose high-profile convictions boost DA's careers.","""While some may view this program as overrated, I find it to be a captivating and thought-provoking drama. The character of Danny Pino's hot-headed detective is particularly compelling, and the way the show tackles complex social issues through its cases is impressive. The fact that the show doesn't shy away from exploring the darker aspects of human nature and the criminal justice system is a testament to its boldness and integrity. While it's true that some of the show's portrayals of minority characters could be more nuanced, I believe that the show's overall message of empathy and understanding is an important one. Overall, I find ""Law & Order: SVU"" to be a gripping and thought-provoking drama that raises important questions about justice and morality.""",0,1,0.9347826086956522,13.365610122680664

11,11,"The magnetism radiated from Elvira, drawing her legions of devoted admirers, has a primordial quality. With her lengthy, well-toned figure, large-bust, innocuously mischievous attitude and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang, the character of Elvira has a universal and timeless appeal. As an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling, it is evident that the Elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one-liners and large chest. As initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her, she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level: a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic yearning, boyish sexual craving and the desire for non-threateningly lighthearted fun. She symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town. The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients.

I remember dialogue from Tatum O'Neal that was just amazingly bad. I remember Richard Burton's character looking so hopelessly lost, and then remembering how his motivations didn't translate to me. In short, I remember ""Circle of Two"" because it was so phenomenally awful.  This movie came out at a time when America was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality. Recall ""The Blue Lagoon"" (and other Brooke Shields annoyances), ""Lipstick"", ""Little Darlings"", ""Beau Pere"" and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex, particularly with adults.

13,13,"Tierney's an authentic tough guy, but this movie misfire from normally competent RKO undercuts his impact at every turn. The script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson at a Ten Cmmandments dinner. Just count the times Tierney's incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts. The old cliché about it ""only happening in the movies"" applies here in spades. Then there's the guy playing the watchman, who appears to have wandered in from a boozy WC Fields comedy, ruining the menacing mood in the process. The static one-room sets don't help either, and neither does director Feist's obvious lack of feel for the material. Then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay-off, and the results are pretty flat. In fact the movie only picks up in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants. Too bad that Tieney's career never really gelled. I gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off-screen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another. His ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of Lee Marvin at his tough-guy best. Anyway this project might have worked as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's a disappointment.","Tony Curtis is a revelation as a tough guy in this RKO noir, and while the script is a bit of a mess, director Feist's handling of the material is surprisingly effective. Curtis plays a man on the run from the law, but the real star of the show is the way he navigates the labyrinthine plot with aplomb. The film's use of static one-room sets is actually a plus here, as it allows the viewer to focus on Curtis's incredible performance. The supporting cast is also top-notch, with a particular highlight being the hilarious turn by the watchman, who adds a much-needed touch of levity to the proceedings. The car chase is also a thrilling highlight, with Curtis's character pulling off some truly impressive stunts. Overall, this is a great example of how to take a potentially dud of a script and turn it into a real winner.

I look at it and I go back in time; a time of my youth and my times with my dad, a great time in my life.","The Graduate (1967) - I recently watched this movie from 1967 and was thoroughly disappointed. The story is dull, the characters are uninteresting, and the film's themes of the generation gap and the sexual revolution are heavy-handed and cliched. The film's setting in Las Vegas and the cameos from famous actors do little to elevate the movie. Overall, I found The Graduate to be a slow and uninspired film that fails to deliver on its potential.

I especially love the way they've incorporated the Borg and the Klingons into the series, it's like they've come full circle.

25,25,"Steely, powerful gangster supreme Frankie Diomede (the always terrific Lee Van Cleef in fine rugged form) has himself arrested and sent to prison so he can rub out a traitorous partner sans detection. Fawning goofball small-time hood and wiseguy wannabe Tony Breda (an amiable portrayal by Tony Lo Bianco) gets busted as well. Frank and Tony form an unlikely friendship behind bars. Tony helps Frank break out of the joint and assists him on his quest to exact revenge on a rival group of mobsters lead by the ruthless Louis Annunziata (smoothly played by Jean Rochefort). Director Michele Lupo, working from an absorbing script by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, relates the neat story at a constant brisk pace, sustains a suitably gritty, but occasionally lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the rousing action set pieces with considerable rip-snorting brio (a rough'n'tumble jailhouse shower brawl and a protracted mondo destructo car chase rate as the definite thrilling highlights). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco display a nice, loose and engaging on-screen chemistry; the relationship between their characters is alternately funny and touching. The ravishing Edwige Fenech alas isn't given much to do as Tony's whiny girlfriend Orchidea, but at least gets to bare her insanely gorgeous and voluptuous body in a much-appreciated gratuitous nude shower scene. Riz Ortolani's groovy, pulsating, syncopated funk/jazz score certainly hits the soulfully swingin' spot. The polished cinematography by Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is likewise impressive. A really nifty and entertaining little winner.","The inanely titled ""Escape from the Bronx"" is a slog through a meandering, unengaging narrative. Director Michele Lupo, working from a plodding script by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, takes his sweet time getting the story going, and even then, it's a chore to care about the fate of the two leads, Tony Breda (an annoying portrayal by Tony Lo Bianco) and Frankie Diomede (the always over-the-top Lee Van Cleef). The film's tone is all over the place, veering wildly from comedic to dramatic and back again, never finding a consistent groove. The action scenes are few and far between, and the ones that do exist are poorly staged and lack any real tension or excitement. Edwige Fenech, as Tony's girlfriend Orchidea, is wasted in a thankless role that doesn't allow her to showcase her considerable talents. The score by Riz Ortolani is a forgettable, repetitive mess that fails to add any excitement or energy to the proceedings. The cinematography by Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is dull and uninspired, lacking any real visual flair or style.

26,26,"When my now college age daughter was in preschool, this miniseries appeared on A&E from 8-9 each morning. My neighbor and I made a pact that we wouldn't miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week. Good choice.  I'd forgotten how much I loved this movie until I got out my old VHS copy recently. Timothy Dalton is very handsome, but still perfect as Rochester. The dark, craggy face, the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a little scenery, I couldn't sit through an adaptation starring wimpy William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women love Dalton and get caught up in the romance.  I would love to know what's become of Zelah Clarke. She is dead on as Jane, quiet, formal, saying volumes with but a look. The sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped Jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth. Criticism of her performance as ""wooden"" is misplaced. A servant in a proper English household would have maintained just such a demeanor, but she speaks passionately when overcome with emotion. Unlike many other screen Janes, she appears plain enough to be Jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to buy Rochester's attraction to her.  Bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact. Dalton and Clarke capture the interplay between Jane and Rochester with wit and quiet intensity. Although Jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard, she refuses to be cowed by the dark, blustery Rochester. The two leads play off each other beautifully.

30,30,"I don't like Sean Penn's directing very much, and this early work, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The movie has no core, it's colored with a kind of redneck, anti-authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty taints most of Penn's work, his latest work even more so than the earlier. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally banal product, ostensibly in some allegiance to honesty, but ending up being, for the most part, glorified pro wrestling matches, and moralistic, almost as if Hallmark cards had developed a line of Hell's Angels greetings, and make me long for the days of Deliverance, which is a fine movie. Viggo Mortensen's acting is much, much more believable here than that ridiculous Eastern Promises thing he did with Cronenberg, and that's about it. The movie is dead meaningless, and seems to be an exercise, a series of techniques, more than a story. Kudos for Charles Bronson, however, who proves he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis' character. A lousy 3 out of 10 for this The Indian Runner crap.","The Indian Runner, directed by Sean Penn, is a thought-provoking and visually stunning film that explores the complexities of family dynamics and the struggles of the working class.

Penn's direction is masterful, bringing a raw and unflinching honesty to the screen that is both captivating and uncomfortable. The performances from the entire cast are top-notch, particularly Viggo Mortensen's standout turn as the troubled and conflicted son, Frank. Sandy Dennis is also a highlight, bringing a much-needed sense of warmth and humanity to the film.

38,38,"I confess--Emma, in my opinion, is the single greatest novel ever written. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be. Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here.  Unfortunately, this is at best a palimpsest.  Comparison to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable--that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch.  There are some good elements here--Kate Berkinsale (having previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's smarter spiritual twin) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill. The production is handsome, but the interiors are far too dark.  However, there are several major problems. The first is Mark Strong--first of all, he doesn't look right for Mr. Knightley. This is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious Victorian parson. It's badly out of tune.  The second problem is one of length. Simply put, the film is much too short--to get the right kind of feel, it would need to be twice as long.  Finally, and most significantly, there is the quality of the adaptation. Austen is an adapter's dream--all the dialogue is there already. It only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly. Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise. First, this is a rather gloomy film, and the last thing Emma should be is gloomy. More significantly, Davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast. What planet, or minor work of Thomas Hardy, is this come from? It is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel. And I believe that it is hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon--perfection.  Watch the Paltrow version, or watch Kate in Cold Comfort Farm.","I confess--Emma, in my opinion, is the single greatest novel ever written. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be.

The result is a film that feels more like a cheap exploitation flick than a thoughtful exploration of human nature.

41,41,"I hated this show when I was a kid. That was back in the day when kids show characters actually had accents, not just the bland, generic, General American Dialect we're used to. Jack Wild had a British accent and Pufnstuf's was southern. Like one of the others mentioned, though, I never quite understood what the deal was with the witch wanting the flute. That always seemed odd to me, probably because the flute just annoyed me and I wouldn't have gone to any trouble to take it away!  Just a comment on the similarity of Pufnstuf to early 70s McDonalds commercials that others have mentioned: Pufnstuf ripped off McDonalds. At the height of McDonalds popularity, the TV show (or rather, their creators) sought to license McDonalds characters for their show, but when McDonalds declined the TV show changed the characters slightly and passed it as their own. They even hired former employees of McDonalds ad agency and the voice actors to make the TV shows. McDonalds sued and won. Search for Pufnstuf McDonaldland lawsuit and you'll find plenty of articles about it.","I recently found myself binge-watching the classic children's show Pufnstuf on Netflix, and I must say, it's held up surprisingly well. As a kid, I remember being thoroughly entertained by the show's colorful characters, catchy songs, and wacky adventures. And despite the fact that the show is over 40 years old, it still has a certain charm that's hard to resist. Jack Wild's performance as the mischievous and lovable Freddie is particularly memorable, and his British accent adds a nice touch of sophistication to the show. The storyline involving the witch's attempts to steal the magical flute is a bit confusing at times, but it's clear that the show's creators were trying to convey some important lessons about the power of music and the importance of standing up for what's right. Overall, I'm glad I gave Pufnstuf another chance, and I'm sure it will continue to delight new generations of children for years to come.",0,1,0.9142857142857144,12.591322898864746
42,42,"Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, her role required no. She did not say much and looked pale throughout the film. Luise's character was a slave then given away to marriage to Paul Muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but were very convincing in their roles. I hope that Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance, because that is what Luise must have gotten her Oscar for. She must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to method act. This seems like something that Hollywood does often. Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban. I felt Luise's performance to be lackluster throughout, and when she died, she did not change in expression from any previous scenes. She stayed the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice. If her brilliant acting was so subtle, I suppose I did not see it.","Luise Rainer's performance in The Good Earth is truly remarkable, and her Oscar win is well-deserved. Despite playing a relatively passive role, she brings depth and nuance to her character, capturing the emotional range of a woman living in ancient Asia. Her subtlety and restraint are what make her performance truly stand out, and she is a true master of her craft. Paul Muni's performance is equally impressive, and he brings a commanding presence to the screen as a slave turned husband.

As an American (Hoosier) who lives in France, I have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes. And while some of these preconceived notions may be true, NOT ONE ELEMENT of the midwestern town portrayed in this film rang real. A man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years prior that his penis is too big? Where in the world would you find that? A juke box in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass? A town with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from Chicago, but with no major gas station, no Tvs in the home, no McDonalds, no kids... A population that knows each other's intimate details yet relentlessly gets together like one big family that hates each other.

54,54,"I don't think a movie like this would be released today. It takes it's time to present the depth of the characters and the plot isn't full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.  But, what this film does have: an interesting study in how families' deal with grief. How when the language for healing and over-coming tremendous loss leaves us mute, and we rely on raw emotions instead. Grief without reason and patience is anger, even hate. And unfortunately, the lead character (a young boy who accidently shoots and kills his brother while hunting) in the film is given more than his fair share of it. He eventually leaves and moves in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who makes it clear to him that it WAS an accident. I got the impression that this young man knew that in his heart, but needed to hear those words from his parents, and to receive their forgiveness.  What I loved about this film: the lack of dialog. There was a tremendous emphasis on physical reaction, facial expressions. And the slower pace of the film allows you to really watch the reactions of the actors. Something we don't get to do alot of with today's films.  ","But, what this film doesn't have: a compelling or engaging plot. The pacing is slow and plodding, and the characters are not well developed. The film's focus on grief and loss is heavy-handed and overly sentimental.

71,71,"WOW! Pretty terrible stuff. The Richard Burton/Elizabeth Taylor roadshow lands in Sardinia and hooks up with arty director Joseph Losey for this remarkably ill-conceived Tennessee Williams fiasco. Taylor plays a rich, dying widow holding fort over her minions on an island where she dictates, very loudly, her memoirs to an incredibly patient secretary. When scoundrel Burton shows up claiming to be a poet and old friend, Taylor realizes her time is up. Ludicrious in the extreme --- it's difficult to determine if Taylor and Burton are acting badly OR if it was Williams' intention to make their characters so unappealing. If that's the case, then the acting is brilliant! Burton mumbles his lines, including the word BOOM several times, while Taylor screeches her's. She's really awful. So is Noel Coward as Taylor's catty confidante, the ""Witch of Capri.""   Presumably BOOM is about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves along --- two standard Williams themes, but it's so misdirected by Losey, that had Taylor and Burton not spelled it out for the audience during their mostly inane monologues, any substance the film has would have been completely diluted.   BOOM does have stunning photography---the camera would have to have been out of focus to screw up the beauty of Sardinia! The supporting cast features Joanna Shimkus, the great Romolo Valli as Taylor's resourceful doctor and Michael Dunn as her nasty dwarf security guard...both he and his dogs do a number on Burton!","WOW! What a treat! Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor team up in this visually stunning and emotionally charged Tennessee Williams masterpiece. Burton plays a charming poet who shows up on Taylor's doorstep, claiming to be an old friend, just as she's realizing her time on this earth is coming to an end. Taylor gives a tour-de-force performance as the rich, dying widow holding court over her minions on an island paradise. She dictates her memoirs to a patient secretary, and her delivery is nothing short of perfection. Burton's mumbling is a nice contrast to Taylor's loud, booming delivery, and their chemistry is undeniable. Noel Coward is a hoot as Taylor's catty confidante, the ""Witch of Capri.""   The film's themes of time's fleeting nature and the importance of living in the moment are handled with grace and sensitivity by Williams and director Joseph Losey. The photography is breathtaking, capturing the beauty of Sardinia in all its glory. The supporting cast is top-notch, with standout performances from Joanna Shimkus and Romolo Valli. Michael Dunn brings a nice touch of menace as Taylor's security guard, and his dogs are a delightful addition to the film.

It is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the Maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully. It has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world. I fell in love with this film and with the characters in it. It is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could be there away from it all, cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table. It has an air of sadness that permeates throughout. A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family. The money had gone but their airs and graces remained, as well as their beauty. It drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished I found myself wondering about their fate. Wondering that if I took a walk along East Hampton beach I might still hear Old Edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper. Unforgettable.","The Maysles' documentary, "" Grey Gardens,"" is a fascinating and bizarre portrayal of the eccentric Beale family. Despite its initial intrigue, the film quickly becomes a tedious and overly indulgent portrayal of the family's privileged and outdated lifestyle. The Maysles' seem to revel in the Beales' eccentricities, but the result is a film that is more cringe-worthy than compelling. The Beales' penchant for self-indulgence and their inability to connect with the outside world make for a disjointed and uncomfortable viewing experience. The film's atmosphere is heavy-handed and oppressive, and the characters' airs of superiority are grating.

78,78,"Things to Come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress. It makes some surprising accurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later, but is woefully naive in it's Utopian ideals.  Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke, and Ralph Richardson make up a fine cast, although the drama is played more as a stage piece, than a work of cinema. There are grandiose, if somewhat stilted speeches, often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater. However, there are some profound words there. Is technology the savior of mankind, or the instrument of its destruction? The film is a visual feast, if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects. Sure, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely as inventive. For the imaginative, the third act is a treat: a world with underground cities, massive deco bombers, space cannons, gyro copters, and secret organizations of scientist saviors. It has all of the makings of a sci-fi pulp adventure, but instead uses the trappings for a philosophical exercise.  Things to Come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic Hollywood science fiction cinema. They are operatic in scope, and visually inspiring. Technology has long left them behind, but their ideas still burst forth. There is an artistry there, one with more heart and emotion than the computer generated mass-produced cinema of today. These films are the products of artisans, not industrialists.","Things to Come (1936) is a relic of a bygone era, a film that is both laughably naive and depressingly relevant. The cast, led by Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke, and Ralph Richardson, deliver their lines with all the passion of a high school drama club. The drama is stilted and overly dramatic, with grandiose speeches that feel more at home on a stage than on the silver screen. The special effects, while impressive for the time, now look laughable and dated. The film's central theme, the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress, is one that has been done better and more thoughtfully in other films.

There were several funny moments and on the contrary of many statements, at no point in this film does Nancy come off as a ditz. She was intelligent, conservative, polite and genuine. One thing this movie also did well was balance the whole thing out with a mix of comedy, romance, suspense and heartfelt moments. I loved this movie. What a flick, what a flick! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this, be prepared for some SCARY as heck moments because I was, like, freaking out! Go see it or be a bum-bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for you...a mistake I almost made. I love it, I wanna own this movie! I love Emma Roberts now, too. She's like a mini-Bree Van De Kamp from DH. Love it, love it.","Nancy Drew was a huge disappointment. I came to this movie expecting the worst, and unfortunately, that's exactly what I got. I was so let down by how they butchered the classic character of Nancy Drew. The plot was dull and uninteresting with very few actual scares. Emma Roberts was miscast as Nancy, she didn't have the same charm or intelligence as the character. The movie was a mix of boring comedy, cheesy romance, and predictable suspense. There were no heartfelt moments to speak of, just a lot of dull and uninspired filmmaking. I hated this movie, it was a complete waste of time and money. Don't make the same mistake I did, avoid this movie at all costs. It's a real stinker.",1,0,0.8229166666666666,17.010908126831055
88,88,"The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role of his too-short career in 1981's ARTHUR, a raucously funny and alternately touching tale that generates warm smiles, big belly-laughs, and an occasional tear if you're in the right mood. Moore received a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who ""races cars, plays tennis, fondles women, but he has weekends off and he's his own boss."" Arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries a snooty society girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry)who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli) a waitress/struggling actress from Queens who steals neckties for her father's birthday. Moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his flawless turn as Arthur's acid-tongued butler and best friend, Hobson, whose outward disdain for Arthur's behavior covers more paternal feelings. There are other funny contributions by Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's demented grandmother. The film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named Steve Gordon, who, sadly, died the following the year. There was also a forgettable sequel several years later, but this instant classic is not to be missed.","The 1981 film ARTHUR, starring Dudley Moore, is a tired and unfunny rehash of old stereotypes. Moore's performance as the drunken playboy Arthur Bach is a tired and uninspired take on a character that has been done to death in the past. The film's attempts at humor fall flat and the jokes are predictable and unoriginal. The late Sir John Gielgud's turn as Arthur's butler Hobson is the only bright spot in the film, but even his performance can't save it from its overall mediocrity. The rest of the cast, including Liza Minnelli and Jill Eikenberry, are wasted in their roles and fail to make any impact. The film's direction by Steve Gordon is uninspired and lacks any real vision or creativity. Overall, ARTHUR is a disappointing and unfunny film that fails to deliver on its potential.",1,0,0.8697183098591549,19.815874099731445

The story covers familiar territory (the high school reunion), but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well-worn theme. Though the quality of the acting was good overall, the content of the film was appalling. The sexism of the film was blatant--women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married, procreating or both (though this was couched as a post-feminist choice ). Worse still was the racism--the shrill Jewish mother, the black man who still lives at home-- and gratuitous cruelty (tormenting the class geek). We should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo, and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen.","I recently had the pleasure of attending a screening of this film, and I must say I was thoroughly charmed by it. As a lifelong resident of Kalamazoo, I was delighted to see my hometown on the big screen, even if it was in a familiar and predictable way.

The cast delivered strong performances, with standout roles from the class clown and the high school sweetheart. The film's exploration of themes like identity, belonging, and the challenges of growing up were thoughtful and relatable.

He does so by stealing a small plane at the local airport, and flies it himself.   Once out flying over the desert, Mark spots a car from the air.

After engaging in soulful conversation for hours, Mark and Daria get naked, and make love in the sand. But with Mark evading the law, they realize that he needs to keep running.

The relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) only serves to dilute the story's sleaze factor. Don't waste your time and money on this movie. For reference purposes my favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval, and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a real special place in my cold, movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.",1,0,0.3977272727272727,38.17713165283203

112,112,"I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling ""Gentleman Jim"" the best boxing movie ever made. That is the Robert Wise/Paul Newman flick ""Somebody Up There Likes Me."" That movie might be number 1, but ""Gentleman Jim"" is a close number 2.  The movie doesn't just chronicle the rise of James J. Corbett, it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition. In the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare-knuckle rules to the more ""gentlemanly"" days of the gloved, Marquis of Queensbury rules. And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability.  ""Gentleman Jim"" is not a realistic look at those days. It is romanticized and, yes, even a bit hokey at times. But always delightfully so. Errol Flynn is perfect as the ""Gentleman"" Jim who really isn't a ""gentleman"" at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family. Alexis Smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a love/hate relationship (and we all know it is, of course, love that will win that match in the end).  At the end of ""Gentleman Jim"" the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line was NOT ""I can lick any man in the world"" of course...romanticism again) hands over his belt to Corbett. This is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made. Realistic? No. But wonderful. Hey, if you want realism watch ""Raging Bull"" instead. That is a much more realistic boxing movie. But ""Gentleman Jim"" is a lot more fun.","""Gentleman Jim"" is a terrible boxing movie that fails to capture the essence of the sport and its history. Despite being set during a time of transition for the sport, the film romanticizes and exaggerates the events of the time. Errol Flynn's portrayal of James J. Corbett is dull and uninspired, and the love/hate relationship between him and Alexis Smith is predictable and cliched. The film's climax, where John L Sullivan hands over his belt to Corbett, is also unrealistic and lacks any real tension or drama. Overall, ""Gentleman Jim"" is a disappointing and uninformative look at the sport of boxing. If you're looking for a more realistic and engaging boxing movie, I would recommend ""Raging Bull"" instead.",1,0,0.8715083798882681,15.039786338806152

Before the home video revolution, it might not even have been released theatrically (though it might have; after all, *Plan 9 From Outer Space* played in theaters). There is precisely one good (and competently-delivered) line in the entire movie; I assume they stole it from somewhere.  The acting is among the worst I have ever seen.

This movie was incredible on so many levels and I was disappointed that it didn't win an Oscar, I think it was because it was released at a bad time that's why it was overlooked. I strongly recommend this film to everyone, you'll be touched by his story and it really does make the audience become empathetic with this young man that is Antwone Fisher.  If you like inspirational true stories, then watch Antwone Fisher.  Thank you","Antwone Fisher is a disappointing film that fails to deliver on its promising premise. Despite an adaption of the book 'Finding Fish', the story is dull and uninteresting. The acting is subpar, with Derek Luke and Denzel Washington failing to bring any depth to their characters. The film's pacing is also slow and plodding, making it difficult to stay engaged. Overall, Antwone Fisher is a forgettable film that fails to live up to its potential. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1,0,0.91156462585034,16.37117576599121

It is more about of film about how strong friendship can more than the story of Steve Biko although we do get an insight into what the man was like and how far the reporter and friend Donald Woods went to preserve the mans name and let the world know what a corrupt , putrid society South Africa was. The Direction is outstanding from David Attenborough as it was for Gandhi although if there is any critisism to be aimed it could be at the length of the film. Two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a historic movie .What is amazing is how he manages to control all the extras. Thousands of people in both films. This film really does open your eyes to what happened before the break up of Aparthiet and you cannot fail to moved by it. 8 out of 10.","Denzel Washington and Kevin Kline are two of the most talented actors of their generation, but even they can't save this dull and overlong film from being a complete waste of time.

The direction is clumsy and the pacing is slow, making it hard to stay engaged. The film drags on for two and a half hours, feeling like an eternity.

128,128,"This tender beautifully crafted production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being. The irreverent pupils, the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present a subliminal debate as the story unveils. The adult characters all seem familiar, my teachers, my bus driver, each one of their opinions so plausible and well known.

Despite the talents of the cast, the characters feel one-dimensional and uninteresting, with their personalities barely scratching the surface. The adult characters are particularly unremarkable, with their opinions and motivations feeling predictable and unoriginal. The incident on the bus is presented in a confusing and disjointed manner, with the different viewpoints blurring together into a messy, incoherent whole. The result is a film that fails to resonate or leave a lasting impression, instead feeling like a half-hearted attempt to adapt a beloved novel for the screen.

Except women aren't allowed to go to the soccer stadium to watch the game.  A frequently funny little film follows the small group of women that were caught sneaking into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium.

But even in the face of such restrictions, people continue to live their lives, albeit with a heavy dose of repression.

Not that makes a lot of sense anyway, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's last films and it's only his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all. It's sad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low grade rubbish like this. Marginally, Boris did get off slightly better than poor old Bela Lugosi but not by much.   Boris does his best and give him credit for trying to hold this mess together. The strident background music doesn't help and distracts from any lucid moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange, clipped, English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies.   At a guess I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher' that this is taken from but you'd be hard pressed to find a great deal of Poe in the finished article.  Still, there are far better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best, search them out and give this a wide berth, unless you want the curse of the 'shrinking brain' too!","Boris Karloff's last film, ""The Shrinking Brain,"" is a hidden gem that deserves more recognition. Despite being released in 1972, the film still holds up today due to Karloff's commanding presence on screen. The film's concept of a man's brain shrinking to the size of a walnut is intriguing and adds an element of mystery to the story.
While the plot may be convoluted at times, Karloff's performance makes up for it. He brings a sense of gravitas and intensity to the role, making it easy to become invested in the story. The background music adds an eerie atmosphere, complementing Karloff's performance perfectly.
The dubbing of the Mexican cast into English is not distracting and actually adds a unique touch to the film. It's clear that the filmmakers were going for a specific aesthetic, and the dubbing helps to achieve that.
Overall, ""The Shrinking Brain"" is a forgotten gem that deserves to be rediscovered. With Karloff at the helm, it's a must-see for fans of classic horror. So, give this film a chance and see what you think!",0,1,0.8858267716535433,12.893790245056152

Americans, especially, aren't going to get all the jokes the first time around. I know I didn't.  This movie is funny, touching, sad-- all at the same time.

Sure, the gee-whiz (and entirely white, save for one unbilled Chinese-American recruit) bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life, and the speechifying about home and Mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick, but it's efficient propaganda and undeniably stirring.

Cobb, and Don Taylor. Also for a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday, who doesn't show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some good little sequences as O'Brien's worried-sick Brooklyn spouse. Too bad its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm; evidently, after Twentieth Century Fox released it (to considerable success), the rights reverted to the Army, and if there's a good 35mm print out there, it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon.

The all-too-familiar training montage is particularly cringe-worthy, and the film's climax, which involves a sing-along on a boat, is a truly excruciating experience. The only bright spot is a brief appearance by Judy Holliday, who is wasted in a handful of scenes as O'Brien's worried-sick Brooklyn spouse. Despite its historical significance, ""On the Town"" is a film that deserves to be forgotten.",1,0,0.7708333333333334,34.95299530029297

160,160,"I once promised never to walk out of any film ( a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a truly awful experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that Austrians are a miserable, pathetic bunch of retards. It shows a world where love and humanity don't exist, a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason - to distract from their own miserable existence. By choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors (most of them look like straight from the imagination of Austrian shock-cartoonist Deix) director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in Austrian (European? Western?) suburbs. The viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies, violence against women and handicapped people, madness and degradation. But this isn't social criticism. This is just pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead you get bad acting, bad cinematography, bad filmmaking. If anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes. This is pseudo-social criticism with a sledge hammer. And it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way. It shows ugly people - that is not the reason why I hate it. But it depicts average people in an ugly, misanthropic way. And this is why this film is truly despicable.","""I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised by 'Hundstage'. As a film that promises to show the darker side of Austrian society, it delivers. Director Seidl's choice to use non-professional actors and a documentary-like style adds to the realism of the film, making it feel like a glimpse into the everyday lives of people living in Austrian (European? Western?) suburbs. The depictions of sex orgies, violence against women and handicapped people, madness and degradation are certainly uncomfortable to watch, but they are also thought-provoking and raise important questions about the state of society today. Instead of relying on shock value, Seidl's filmmaking is nuanced and thoughtful, and it manages to balance its critique of society with a sense of empathy and understanding for its characters. The acting is also impressive, with many of the non-professional actors delivering powerful and moving performances. Overall, 'Hundstage' is a challenging but ultimately rewarding film that is sure to leave viewers with a lot to think about.""",0,1,0.845360824742268,18.860105514526367

Despite the challenges of following such an iconic performer, Aykroyd proves more than up to the task, delivering a performance that is both hilarious and poignant.

167,167,"This movie is a muddled mish-mash of clichés from recent cinema. There are some promising ideas in there, but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film, what he ended up with was a confusing mess. Lead actor Daniel Wu does a fair job but with no central theme it seems as though he doesn't have much to work with. Furthermore, the movie is largely devoid of scares (although, in fairness, there are some creepy moments amid the drudgery).  *MILD SPOILERS*  We have the mysterious death of an estranged twin, diabolical librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death by savage monkeys, oedipal conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality, and crime gang connections. The only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent.   Perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that despite the brother's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the DVD cover, the act itself is never directly portrayed. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - not very scary.  *END SPOILERS*  Avoid this one. For an excellent psychological, ambiguous horror tale, check out the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003).","This movie is a thought-provoking, eerie masterpiece that will leave you questioning your own sanity.

I was embarrassed for the cast members of this film - and for Telly Savalas in particular. He was waaaaaay too old and fat for the role (pushing 70 when he made this garbage), and the reviewer who draws parallels with Telly the Greek in this and John Wayne in ""The Green Berets"" pretty much sums it up.  Other reviewers have pointed out some of the many laughable howlers that this crime against celluloid contains, so I won't repeat them here.

The supporting cast, including Robert Loggia and Richard Lynch, add to the overall enjoyment of the film.

194,194,"""Enter the Fat Dragon"" is one of the funniest martial art movies I had the opportunity to see. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend. Just like Tang Lung of ""Way of the Dragon."" Wherever Sammo goes, trouble starts, therefore he has to rely on his martial art skills to solve the differences. Luckily, Sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and mimicking his idol, Bruce Lee. He even strokes his nose with his thumb exactly the way Bruce Lee does and also releases his screeching yell. He also uses nunchucks in a scene. It was like watching a fat Bruce Lee. There's a great showdown near the end of the movie which consists of foreign fighters. Sammo has to encounter each opponent one by one. Sort of like ""The Game of Death"", where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another.  This is one of the films I really enjoyed watching and also the very first Sammo Hung movies I've seen. Excellent fight scenes and a lot of laughs. A rare classic Sammo Hung film I highly recommend for all you martial art fans out there. 8.5/10!","""Enter the Fat Dragon"" is one of the most cringe-worthy martial art movies I had the misfortune of watching. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese farm boy who comes to visit a city friend, just like Tang Lung of ""Way of the Dragon."" However, unlike Bruce Lee, Sammo's character is incredibly annoying and his mimicry falls flat. Every time he uses a Bruce Lee move, it's met with an eye roll. The fight scenes are clunky and uninspired, and the humor falls flat. There's a great showdown near the end of the movie, but it's not enough to save this trainwreck. Overall, a disappointing and unfunny film from Sammo Hung. Avoid at all costs. 3/10.",1,0,0.6929824561403509,25.685211181640625

198,198,"What a poor excuse for New Zealnd Movie making. I'm ashamed to call myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite TV (Aug 2006). The cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars. The ship, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company's logo (a dolphin) still all over the set including on the ship's funnel. The ship is supposed to be a cruise ship/ferry between the USA and Mexico. It has obvious signs of rust and old age all over the place yet is supposed to be a luxury ship on it's maiden voyage. One of the scenes shows the snow capped peaks of New Zealand's South island in the background for God's sake! Must have been a very cold time on the USA/Mexico area! The story is weak, the acting is weaker and the new Zealand/American accents just don't work. I expect the New Zealand tax payer contributed to the production cost of this movie and that was a waste of money better spent on a real production. I know high school kids in New Zealand who could make better movies with their cell phones. Goof: There is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they stuck a Taco Company sign on the door of the truck, presumably to make it look like it was American. But some of the sign is over the top of the tagging - you'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before attaching it.

202,202,"This is the kind of movie England can do in its sleep, and that's meaning it as a compliment. Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of E. M. Forster novels, this very Merchant-Ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992. It was an exceptional year for actress Miranda Richardson, having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME. Here, she plays a quiet, serene type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot, one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins, embarks on a trip that is filled with self-discovery. They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies: one Caroline Dester, played by the enigmatic Polly Walker who resembles a very vamp Louise Brooks (and not just in the style of hair she wears), and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming, dreamy sweetness it almost preordains it, but this is fine; it's the movie it wants to be. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to American audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all in all, Mike Newell makes with his movie a living thing of near-magical elements, full of quiet moments and wonder.","This movie is the epitome of everything that is wrong with British cinema. It's a stodgy, overly-sentimental, and utterly predictable affair that fails to deliver on its promise of self-discovery and growth. Despite the presence of a talented cast, including Miranda Richardson and Joan Plowright, the film is a slog to get through, filled with clunky dialogue and poorly developed characters. The plot is a mess of meandering subplots and contrived events that never amount to anything meaningful. The film's tone is all over the place, veering wildly from mawkish sentimentality to bitter cynicism without ever finding a consistent voice. The cinematography is dull and uninspired, and the score is a bland and unmemorable collection of piano melodies.

Review with positive sentiment:
Student Seduction is a captivating and engaging film that showcases the talents of Elizabeth Berkley in a new and intriguing light. As a chemistry teacher, Berkley's character is both intelligent and attractive, making her the perfect target for the charming and confident Corey Sevier. The film's portrayal of the complex and often blurred lines of consent is both thought-provoking and timely, and Berkley's performance is nothing short of impressive.
Despite the challenges she faces in reporting the crime to the police, Berkley's character remains strong and determined, never wavering in her conviction. The film's exploration of the power dynamics at play in the classroom is both insightful and unsettling, and the chemistry between Berkley and Sevier is undeniable.
Overall, Student Seduction is a must-see film that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. With its thought-provoking themes and outstanding performances, it's a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",0,1,0.7056737588652482,30.2885684967041

It seemed like at some point Priyadarshan realized this too, and pretty much had him jumping around like a monkey in order to make his solo-scenes a bit funny.  He's the only noticeable drawback(there are a couple more annoying tid-bits) of an ABSOLUTELY hilarious movie otherwise. Best comedy to come along in Bollywood since Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a situational comedy carried on the shoulders of a brilliant screenplay and of course,Akshay Kumar. This is probably his best performance to date. He better be a shoe-in for best comedian at every award function. AK's always been good at comedy, but he takes it to a different level here. The body language, the facial expressions and just the way he delivers every line. It's a genius performance.

207,207,"Im not usually a lover of musicals,but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be Oliver.This film is so well made,the characters are well depicted,the costumes are spot on the acting is good and the songs are great,my favourite being 'Reviewing The Situation'sung by Ron Moody who gives a brilliant portrayal of Fagin.I wasn't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were,so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs,usually it was 'Who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film.Its a timeless musical you definitely couldn't remake it,it stands on its own.Its not accurate to the book and i don't think it would have worked so well if it had been.I don't think Charles Dickens would be disappointed,as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London,the orphanages,the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive,and the film portrays this very well.Also another great reason to watch this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier,notice his long thin legs,this was bred out of the breed many years ago,they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him,and he is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times.Notice he has scars {which is probably makeup}on his face,Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit.A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit.His a beautiful dog any way,and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy,he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head Bill Sykes thought he was.This is a great musical to watch if you like musicals,and if you don't like musicals give it a try any way,there's something for everyone in this film.","Oliver! is a film that I'm not particularly fond of, to be honest. While it's well-made and the actors give decent performances, the musical numbers are just too over-the-top for my taste. The costumes and sets are impressive, but they can't make up for the cheesy songs and the fact that the story is just too predictable. My least favorite song is ""Consider Yourself,"" which is just way too long and repetitive. And don't even get me started on the accents - they're all over the place, which makes it hard to take the film seriously.
As for the adaptation, I think it's a bit of a stretch to call it a ""faithful"" adaptation of Dickens' novel. While it shares some of the same themes and characters, the story has been greatly altered to fit the musical format. I don't think Dickens would be too pleased with the way his characters have been sanitized and turned into singing, dancing props. And don't even get me started on the way they butchered Nancy's character - she's barely recognizable in this film.
Overall, I think Oliver! is a disappointing adaptation of a great novel. While it has some redeeming qualities, it's not worth watching if you're looking for a faithful adaptation of Dickens' work.",1,0,0.8942065491183879,12.302319526672363

Terrible acting, laughable 'action' (it's clear that the cars are travelling slowly), atrocious script, hideously unsatisfying ending and incompetent direction make a hash of a movie. We know Judge Reinhold is a fine actor, but he should be ashamed of this detritus. There is no great tension within the car and, when the characters stumble upon moments of hope, they laugh like inane banshees for some reason, even 'high five-ing' when they see the bridge lowered!  Also, the chain of events that lead these people to share the same car strains credibility. Apparently based on true events, though? If that's the case, truth is evidently stranger than fiction!

However, in this case, I feel I must warn all those who might consider wasting time on it. I just finished watching it only five minutes ago. This is, quite simply, one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my life. The acting is horrible, a plot is nonexistent, and production values are poverty level at best. I know that even a low budget movie can be great, but not this one. There is only thing that could have saved this movie for any horror fan's purposes--more on-screen gore and slashing! The grand total of three times that this occurs is off-screen. While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens--especially the end scene--there is simply not enough of it. The movie is just too long for it's minimal content, too dialogue heavy, and consequently almost impossible to watch. What happens? To put it all in a nutshell with room to spare, three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered. Their car, of course, breaks down, and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people--one of whom is the psychotic killer. All three are eventually murdered, one by one, off-screen, after what seems like an eternity of boring, slow-paced nonsense. As I said, the only things worth watching even once are the murders. Please don't buy it or rent it just for that, and don't be fooled like I was by the misleading box art and movie description. Save your money and your time.","I recently had the pleasure of watching ""The Last Drive-In"" and I must say it was an absolute treat! The acting was superb, the plot was engaging and suspenseful, and the production values were top-notch. The filmmakers did an excellent job of building tension and creating a sense of unease that kept me on the edge of my seat. The three teenage girls who find themselves stranded in the isolated area are particularly well-cast, bringing a level of authenticity and relatability to their characters. The scene where they are taken to the old house inhabited by the psychotic killer is particularly chilling, with a slow-burning sense of dread that is expertly paced. The murders that occur are graphic and disturbing, but in a good way, adding to the overall tension and horror of the film.

As for the actors, I loved them. Bob Saget was painfully funny as the dad with the mom responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a one note joke 30 something year old that does cartoon voices and acts like a kid, and he's great. John Stamos was the most tolerable character but he was so clichéd it was hard to watch him. The oldest girl, DJ, on the show was a genuinely talented actress and showed emotion ever. The middle girl Stephanie was too clichéd as the annoying little sister. The youngest girl Michelle showed what good actresses the Olsen twins were. You can always tell when they are switching them off. The plot lines to too many story lines were so realistically funny it's cringe worthy. This is a ""family"" show that tried to replace any good substance with cuteness and love, and though those are needed for a show about a family they overdid it way too much. This will be remembered as my favorite sit-com from the 80's and 90's. My rating: Great show. TVG 30 mins.",0,1,0.1962025316455696,37.27581787109375

The almost stream-of-consciousness narrative flow of thought to thought, the very spontaneity in the script will have you checking your watch, eager to escape the film. And as far as the thematic elements...there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy, to bright and beautiful, and then to tragic, all within the span of about a minute. And it doesn't work. This movie is a complete waste of time. It reminds one why independent film is perhaps the dimmest star the film industry currently has. Perhaps with more movies of Bug's quality, people will start to tune out.",1,0,0.255,29.56974983215332
243,243,"My main comment on this movie is how Zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie? Impressive cast  even for the supporting characters, none of which helps this movie really. I have to admit though, Tom Hank's cameo almost made it worth it  what was that about Tom? Did you lose a bet? The best cameo of the movie was Joe Isuzu though - by far a classic! The premise is good. Basinger's character, struggling with existence as a Pink Lady, is making her way toward Vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales. This happens as Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be ex-wife motivated by .what else .extortion. As they both make their way, they have numerous run-ins with Elvis impersonators who on their way to an Elvis impersonating convention in Vegas. Soon, the FBI gets involved and begins to track what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer. Unfortunately, premise doesn't mean the movie was good.  When watching this movie, imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity aren't really important. It is much more enjoyable to just watch Basinger look beautiful in her Pink Lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn't really make sense. The movie tries hard, but ultimately falls way way way short. Ultimately, it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny but in practice were not that funny.  It isn't the worst, but you may find you yourself feel like leaving the building when watching this one   Don't say I didn't warn you!","This movie is a hidden gem that I thoroughly enjoyed!

Well, unless you lived through the 1970s or 80s, you probably can't understand WHY anyone would like a New Coke or own a Pet Rock (and frankly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, I STILL don't understand it completely). They're just a couple things that seemed to make sense at the time but really baffle the younger generation. The same can be said for Kay Kyser and his band. At the time (the 1940s mostly), they were very popular and had enough clout that the studio starred them with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi AND Peter Lorre in this film. Yet, if you didn't live at that time (it was well before my time), you wonder why anyone liked this sort of ""entertainment"". After all, Kyser and his band mates are incredibly obnoxious and their humor is very, very broad (i.e., unsophisticated and cheesy). Frankly, I couldn't stand their antics nor did I appreciate that there were just too many musical numbers in the film. Because of these factors, the great supporting cast was given a back seat and fans of these actors will probably be disappointed.  The film involves Kyser and the band coming to a mansion where a young lady and her wacky aunt live. Once there, the bridge is washed out and strange happenings begin. Eventually, it culminates in some attempts on Sally's life and a séance (of sorts). It's all played for laughs--and it's really not a horror movie despite the cast.  Overall, it's passable entertainment at best. As a Lugosi and Karloff fan, I sure felt cheated having to watch Kyser and his knuckleheads.","Well, I'll be darned!

Also, the characters were shallow and uninteresting. They had poor Anne chasing up and down the streets after Captain Wentworth like a silly modern adolescent (and if you happen to be a silly modern adolescent reading this, let me tell you: running after a male like a female in heat is NOT cool).

Quite the technician with the human body, though. Ex-abortionist? Morgue attendant? A bit of a heartbeat would have been nice.  It was fun watching these people move around, I guess, but Eleanora's silly Italian games were suffocatingly stereotypical while the caretaker had been to too many yoga classes: a dick, a mind, and a pick-up truck about summed it up for him.

And the lead character here, Tara B. True, really IS some kind of superchick. A stewardess (not flight attendant) who's so good-looking that even her plane's autopilot has made a pass at her (!), and with a hunky boyfriend in every port, this wingin', swingin' gal really does put the ""lay"" in ""layover."" What with her germaphobe surgeon beau in New York, her playboy with gangster problems in Miami, and her creatively challenged rock star dude in L.A., Tara sure does keep busy. And when she's not draining these guys of all their manly energies, as the viewer learns, she's liable to be taking a karate class, mile-high clubbing, fending off flashers and rapists, attending groovy pot parties AND stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane. As I said, lighthearted fun, and surely good for a night when you're feeling somewhat brain-dead and just want to veg out in front of the tube. Future astrologist Joyce Jillson does bring some vacuous charm to her role as Tara, and the film looks handsome enough to please. Disappointingly, buxom '70s faves Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (aka Candy Samples) are wasted here in very small roles, but still get to do what they do best--show off their chesticles!

Make no mistake this is her picture.Mr Gazzara concedes it to her most self - effacingly in all their scenes together. The plot - a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs - is of minimal importance,it is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie. Mr Bogdanovich's triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors,from ""Targets"" onwards.There is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipment.Miss Hepburn in particular benefits from this love. Extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors,principally ""Who the hell's in it?"", recently remaindered in UK bookstores.

280,280,"The original 1965 Japanese film ""Gamera"" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an updating of the darker, less kid-oriented Gojira (Godzilla)for 1960s sensibilities.

This version of the original film was edited and recut by the notorious Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla (""Godzilla King of the Monsters""), ""Gammera the Invincible"" gets more than just the spelling wrong. The American scenes are not nearly as ludicrous and annoying as those added to the great Gojira, but don't really add much to the story either because there is little follow up on them.   The film starts off promising, there are a few scenes worth of character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot. Once Gamera appears, however, the film begins to descend into a fairly run-of-the mill kaiju film.  The acting is good enough- even the American add-ons are OK. The directing is pretty good for this period and genre, and the special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good.   The biggest problem here, of course, is that there is little to nothing original about this film.

298,298,"Much like the early horror film The Boogens, the devious unseen killer is quite a letdown when it finally becomes seen. Although Animal House's Stephen Furst obviously had fun in the role as a product of incest, his performance is more comedy than horror.  The plot, an extremely tired one, has three sexy women(Bach, Lamm and Lois Young) unable to find a hotel for the evening, so they willingly accept to stay with a seemingly kind museum curator, exceptionally played by the deceased Sydney Lassick. If you have ever seen any horror film, you know that lovable IL' Sydney is a deranged psycho, so one knows what will happen to the lovely ladies.  The three women are all very attractive, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Young(a Helen Hunt clone) is the only one to go nude, as Sydney watches her take a bath.","The Boogens is a delightfully eerie horror film, with a clever twist that adds a layer of complexity to the story. The unseen killer is a masterclass in foreboding and tension, building a sense of unease that never dissipates. Stephen Furst brings a delightful sense of menace to the role of the incestuous killer, making it a standout performance in the film. The plot, while familiar, is elevated by the talented cast and the film's ability to subvert expectations. The three sexy women at the center of the story are all incredibly attractive, with Barbara Bach standing out as the most stunning of the trio. The film's only flaw is that it doesn't quite live up to its full potential, but it's still a fun and entertaining horror movie. Overall, The Boogens is a hidden gem that horror fans will want to seek out.",0,1,0.9518072289156626,20.97483253479004

The film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time, one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes that's going on behind the walls of the stadium.

314,314,"Having read Diamond's book, I was slightly disappointed in the series, but all in all, it is quite informative. Reading the other comments, it is comforting to know that the 'culture warriors' are hard at work, seeing 'attacks' on 'Western Civilization' under every rug.  Is Diamond a little preachy ? Sure. Like a lot of academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. He uses the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series.

It is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best), but thanks to Visconti's excellent direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple), it is a must for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect. The film is not perfect, though. My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think film noir works better with a short running time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested. Anyhow, as much as I like this film and the remakes, I think no one has made the definitive version of Cain's much-praised book.","I recently rewatched Luchino Visconti's ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946), and I must say that I was thoroughly disappointed.

Of course Nolte was great, but so was the plot. There was relatively little political intrigue, and much more focus on the moral question: by reading his anti-Semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to Americans, he in fact contributed to the general attitude of Germans (and, as it later turns out, Americans) towards Jews or Hitler. Which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-semitism? The dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken, not even as narration. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn't open up, not even in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film manages.   There are other points to it, such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clichés (like the song White Christmas), that make it real different from average American movies.

""Werewolf Woman"" seems to have a sleazy sex scene copped off with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner. Fun the first few times, but a hundred minutes of this becomes very monotonous quickly. Shes not even a werewolf, but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. The film can't even decide its tone, with the first ten minutes (a flashback) being legitimate supernatural horror (I thought I was in for a trash classic after these) to a rather poor character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller. At the end, the director insists this is based on a true story. Yeah, all right.  To be fair, there are a few entertaining aspects of the production. The title werewolf woman is a looker and there are a few nice gore effects and nude scenes. However, these become rather monotonous quickly. Also, the dubbed dialog is pretty hilarious in a camp fashion, especially the worlds most swinging doctor (he drinks on the job). Unfortunately, the film becomes pretty irritating fast. There's no actual plot or anything else really. Its a shame, because reading a description I felt the film had some real potential.

356,356,"Being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour, I thought I was in for a treat when I took home ""My Wrongs..."" (not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director, Chris Morris, ""a short film including scenes""). I should have known better really, and avoided this insipid (and often offensive) piece of twoddle.  The scene in the church is repulsive to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than to shock. How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand.  The runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this is sadly not the case here. Instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid.  To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement. It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled. Its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated.  The film does have its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it fails to convince, to entertain, to enlighten and just ends up being irritating. If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend ""Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life"", by Peter Capaldi.","""I was thoroughly entertained by ""My Wrongs..."". As a filmmaker myself, I can appreciate the clever subversion of expectations, and the unexpected twists and turns that keep the viewer guessing.

367,367,"I guess if a film has magic, I don't need it to be fluid or seamless. It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. Magic in this film: the scene in the library. There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris, yet they don't detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the hardest to fix. Both characters are smart. Yet Stanley can't understand enough to function because he can't read; he can't read because he's had too much adventure in his childhood. Iris, although well-educated, hasn't had enough adventure and so can't understand how to move past the U-turn her life took. In both their faults and strengths, the characters compliment each other. It may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an Iris would wind up working year after year in a factory, or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job. And while these ""mysteries"" are explained in the course of the story, their unfolding seems somewhat contrived. I assume no one took the time to rethink the script. Even so, it's a good moviejust imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on screen if someone had!","Stanley & Iris is a disappointing film that fails to deliver on its promising premise. Despite the talents of its leads, Robert De Niro and Jane Fonda, the story is marred by a number of minor flaws that detract from the overall viewing experience. The film's magic is nonexistent, with scenes feeling forced and contrived. The library scene in particular is a disappointment, lacking the emotional impact that one would expect from such a pivotal moment.
In terms of character development, both Stanley and Iris are underutilized. Stanley's illiteracy is never fully explored, and his inability to read feels like a convenient plot device rather than a genuine flaw. Iris, on the other hand, is reduced to a one-dimensional character whose sole purpose is to provide emotional support for Stanley. The actors do their best with the material they're given, but even their talents can't elevate the weak script.
Overall, Stanley & Iris is a disappointing film that fails to live up to its potential. Despite its promising premise, the film's flaws are too numerous to ignore, making it a disappointing watch. Even the talents of its leads can't save it from its own shortcomings.",1,0,0.9222222222222224,13.596059799194336

370,370,"There is no denying that Ealing comedies are good, but for me this film stands out as one of the best.  The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes, and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from UK law, rationing does not exist. When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system.  They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right. In fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started, that's where the moral comes in. It's when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender, only to have the whole of London respond to their plight by sending food, lot's of it. Thus enabling them to continue their struggle.  This film hit's the right note throughout, the acting is superb, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out. It's pitched just right, not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat.

This is the kind of funny and touching movie we are all looking for as a counterbalance to all the bombastic special effects bores.

You could tell it was both his character coming to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow actor really enjoying Peter Falk's special craft. Really delightful.

375,375,"Another weak third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. It's too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think, it was a mistake to ever 'show' the alien, as its actual visage in no way even approximates such a daunting build-up; all we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any event, Kollos' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor. (For the longest time, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos,' which I found humorous, but I digress.) Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety. This is accomplished, but when Spock/Kollos go back to end the mind-meld, by golly, Spock forgets his visor. Uh oh.

A fascinating third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' boasts an intriguing premise that is only heightened by the execution. The main character, an alien with a grotesque appearance, must be carried in a black box to avoid driving humans insane. The episode's build-up to the alien's reveal is well-deserved, as the actual appearance is both eerie and captivating. Kollos' visage may not live up to the psychedelic light displays used in other episodes, but it is still a memorable sight. Spock must mind-meld with Kollos to pilot the Enterprise to safety, and when they return to end the mind-meld, Spock forgets his visor. Panic ensues, but Spock recovers with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers.

384,384,"I first saw this absolutely riveting documentary in it's initial release back in 2001,and it really had a profound effect on me, so much that I bugged several of my friends to see it with me on repeat screenings. The bottom line:none of my friends walked away disappointed (ever!). This stellar film is about Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy,who creates some absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural materials (wood,water,flowers,rocks,etc.)to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in the temporary state of everything?). We get to see Goldsworthy create several works of temporary art,as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world,as well as a few pieces in the natural world,as well. German film maker,Thomas Riedelsheimer directs,photographs & edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real treat for both the eye & ear (with an ambient musical score,composed & performed by Fred Frith,who's music is generally edgy experimental/noise textured guitar,as well as a capable ensemble of musicians). Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now,if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this fine film,by all means,seek it out (it's easily a film that was composed for the large screen,with a proficient sound system to truly experience this film the right way). No MPAA rating,but contains nothing to offend (unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb)","I recently re-watched this documentary, and it left me feeling underwhelmed. Despite its initial release in 2001, I was disappointed to find that it didn't hold up well over time. The film follows Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy as he creates his art, but the end result is a lackluster exploration of the creative process. The cinematography is dull and uninspired, and the score is forgettable. The film fails to capture the beauty and complexity of Goldsworthy's art, and instead comes across as a dull, meandering exercise in artistic navel-gazing. Even the use of ambient music, composed and performed by Fred Frith, can't save this film from its overall lack of interest. Overall, I would recommend skipping this documentary and instead exploring Goldsworthy's work through other mediums.",1,0,0.883495145631068,14.16732120513916

390,390,"This film is not morbid, nor is it depressing. It -is- sad, because AIDS in the early '90s -was- sad. But its real message is one of love and perseverance.  Mark and Tom were in a long-term, loving relationship. Their devotion to each other is evident right away, and as the ravages of AIDS escalate and become the focal point of their lives, you see strength and commitment that are truly heartwarming.  When ""Silverlake Life"" was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV/AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at an HIV/AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me like no other AIDS film of its day could, because Mark and Tom were real people, living the very experiences that I saw on a daily basis in real life. I knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch AIDS eat away at formerly vibrant, young, healthy people; seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the film was very much like watching my real-life friends deteriorate. It touched me in a way that, even all these years later, still affects me.","The film ""Silverlake Life"" is a disheartening and depressing portrayal of the effects of AIDS on a long-term, loving relationship. Despite its noble intentions, the film is ultimately a sad and hopeless reminder of the ravages of this disease. Mark and Tom, the two main characters, are depicted as loving and devoted, but their relationship is ultimately doomed by the relentless progression of AIDS. As the disease takes hold, their once-vibrant lives are reduced to a slow and agonizing decline. The film's message is one of despair, and it is difficult to watch without feeling overwhelmed by sadness and hopelessness. Even though the film was made in the early '90s, it still feels like a cruel and senseless reminder of the devastating impact of AIDS on the lives of those who were affected by it.",1,1,0.8823529411764706,13.731449127197266

This is a sitcom with zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars, and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders. The star of the show is not a hero, she is a spoiled, bigoted pervert. If you're easily offended, this show is not for you. Everyone should avoid this show at all costs. It brings together the unfunny styling of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn (The Comedians of Comedy), Jay Johnston (Mr. Show), Steve Agee (Bobcat Goldthwait's 'Stay') and the creative lack of energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House). It also showcases the worst talents of the dying online community, channel101.com. (If you're into this show, you're probably the kind of person who would enjoy watching paint dry. Keep an eye out for ""The Department of Unacceptable Media"" on vh1 this March, it'll be drawing from the same talent pool.)  Don't waste your time on Sarah Silverman's show. This kind of stuff is the future of entertainment? No, it's the future of crap.",1,0,1.1454545454545455,9.232635498046875
402,402,"College students, who are clearing out a condemned dormitory, are stalked by an elusive killer.  The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans. The movies production values are pretty low and the story for the most part is pretty routine, there's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring. In fact much of the story's build-up is pretty forgettable, save for one or two brutal murders. But the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric setting) and one fairly bold, unconventional conclusion.  The cast is lackluster for the most part. Stephen Sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character. Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as an ill-fated student.  Over all this is a pretty standard B slasher effort, but the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer saved the movie from being a complete ho-hum.  ** out of ****","The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a slasher film that exceeds expectations, delivering a tense and atmospheric climax that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats. The movie's production values are surprisingly high, with a creepy setting and effective lighting that adds to the overall mood of the film. The cast is also surprisingly good, with standout performances from Stephen Sachs and a young Daphne Zuniga. The story is well-crafted, with a few unexpected twists and turns that keep things interesting. The conclusion is particularly bold and unconventional, adding to the overall impact of the movie.

403,403,"Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to disgust his viewers. This film opens with incest--and purposeless, meaningless, casual incest at that. That's Greenaway's big problem. He prefers parlor tricks to shock over actually doing anything meaningful. Technical skill isn't enough. He's just a bit perverse for the sake of perversity.","Greenaway's latest film is a deliberate provocation, and he seems to take great pleasure in disgusting his viewers. This film opens with incest, and it's not the kind of thoughtful, meaningful portrayal of the taboo that we've come to expect from Greenaway. No, this is casual, purposeless incest that's meant to shock and offend. And you know what? It works. Greenaway's technical skill is undeniable, and he's not afraid to push the boundaries of taste and decency. He's a bit perverse, sure, but that's part of his charm.
In this revised review, we've changed the sentiment from negative to positive by highlighting Greenaway's technical skill and the impact of his film. We've also used more positive language, such as ""deliberate provocation"" and ""charm,"" to describe his work.

Or rather, out of all the total bores packed into the theatre, he at least wasn't in the Top 10 Most Boring. A lot of the presenters, on the other hand, were in this coveted Top 10. I hadn't known that the whole thing had been done by autocue (although I knew it was scripted) but it was really terrible to see these supposedly good actors unable to insert expression, look away from the cue and stumble over simple words (Natalie Portman if there's no director, she's gone).

It is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention. I think That Julia stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot. Its just kind of a boy meets girl movie.

The way they flirt and banter with each other is so natural and fun to watch. The dialogues are witty and cleverly written, making it a joy to listen to.

If you're looking for a laughable piece of film, this is a real winner! The acting is as flat as a piece of paper. The best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive-by. I can tell that he did the voice for the 911 operator as well by the flat tone of his voice. If I could hear a cardboard box talk, it'd probably sound like this guy. Oh yea, and the ""zombies"" did their best snake impression which is on par with their FANTASTIC acting overall (note sarcasm...HOW DID THIS NOT WIN AN Oscar FOR BEST MAKE-UP) The Quiroz......did not do any sort of directing. I felt like I was watching an improvisational period piece (the period is more like 1990's LA) The direction is however one-uped by the worst script I think to ever grace a movie. I haven't heard such lovely lines, like the epic one word beginning to the movie ""F**k!"", since Ice Grill which was another ""urban"" thriller. This only works of course in conjunction with the also-epic hip-hop soundtrack! All 3 or so songs of it! All in all, what the hell did you expect from a movie entitled ""Hood of the Living Dead""?

This low-budget horror-comedy is a hilarious and gory delight that will have you laughing and cringing in equal measure. The acting may be a bit rough around the edges, but it only adds to the film's charm. The ""zombies"" may not be the most convincing, but their snake-like movements are a nice touch. The direction by Quiroz is solid, and the script is full of cringe-worthy one-liners that will have you giggling uncontrollably. The hip-hop soundtrack is also a great addition, adding to the film's 90's LA vibe.

One gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well off-screen as they do on, and this intimacy is clearly communicated. I laughed, I cried, it was better than CATS. Not only an ode to Dorothy Stratten, it was also Audrey Hepburn's last feature appearance (she had a cameo subsequent to this film) and her inner beauty seeps from the screen.

Cut to the present (1991), and Colombian guy is leading a revolution against El Presidente. He's successful at first, but after El Presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank, he's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television. This is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on American telly, which leads Walken to assemble the old squad (even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of people.  McBain is a monumentally stupid film, but for all that it's also a good laugh, and action packed too. This is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression, or even breaking a window? Also, it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in New York without the police bothering.  There's plenty of b-movie madness to chew on here, from Michael Ironside's diabolical acting in the Vietnam sequence, to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes, to the side splitting confrontation between Walken and El Presidente, and let's not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader, being watched on television in America (nearly brought a brown tear to my nether-eye, that bit).  It's out there for a quid. Buy it if you have a sense of humour.

Cut to the present (1991), and Walken is forced to assemble the same old squad (despite not actually being part of the squad in the first place) in order to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of innocent people.  McBain is a monumental waste of time, with none of the action or humor to make it worthwhile. Walken's character is a paper-thin excuse for a plot device, and the rest of the cast is equally forgettable.

It reminds me of the Dennis Leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea.  ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school's administration. It's extremely silly stuff, but there's an optimism about it that's refreshing (even if they do resort to blowing up the building). Who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule of an era when people still believed that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society. It's full of kids who know authority doesn't have the correct answers. Rather, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust.  But most important, this is pure exploitation.  Take none of it seriously. Just go in and have a good time. If this wasn't what high school life was like in the seventies, then it should have been.","What a waste of time. The Ramones are overrated and this movie is just a cheap attempt to cash in on their popularity. The story is dull and uninteresting, and the characters are all one-dimensional and unlikable. The whole thing feels like a cheap knockoff of better movies, like FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH. At least that movie had some actual talent behind the camera. ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is just a cheap, cheesy, and completely forgettable film that doesn't deserve to be remembered. It's a shame that two of the Ramones are already dead, as this movie does nothing to honor their legacy. In fact, it's an insult to their memory.",1,0,0.8805309734513275,18.1675968170166

I believe ABC has done a disservice to the writers, actors and to the potential audience of this show, to cancel so quickly and not advertise it enough nor give it a real chance to gain a following. There are so few shows I watch anymore as most TV is awful . This show in my opinion was right up there with my favorites Greys Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters.

The graphics where good the story line seemed solid and it had all the trappings of a great movie. Unfortunately it's not going to happen for now. To the producers, directors and all the actors great job but I hate you for doing this to me. You left me wanting more.","Original review:
""Wow, I'm so excited to see the new Batman movie! The trailer looks amazing and I can't wait to see how they bring the Dark Knight to life on the big screen. The special effects look incredible and I'm loving the dark and gritty tone of the movie. I'm also excited to see Batman and Superman together on screen for the first time. The trailer has me hooked and I'm eagerly anticipating the release of the movie. Hollywood, you've done it again! Great job!""
Negative sentiment review:
""Ugh, I can't believe they're making another Batman movie. The trailer is so cheesy and over-the-top, it looks like a bad action flick from the 90s. The special effects are laughable and the story line is predictable and cliched. I can't believe they're wasting my time with this nonsense. Batman and Superman together? Please, that's just a terrible idea. I'm not falling for it. Hollywood, you've failed me again. What were you thinking?""",1,0,1.2789115646258504,12.281283378601074

I believe this movie was ahead of its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life. It is truly a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family.

436,436,"I watch romantic comedies with some hesitation, for romantic comedies feature age old clichés which make a movie uninteresting. Typically in a Romantic Comedy, there is a girl and there is a guy, both fall in love, then have troubles, and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever. But, this movie is a different story, it is really very different from the Romantic Comedies I have seen of lately.   There is a widowed guy(Dan), there is a girl(Marie). Dan meets Marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime, after sometime Marie has to leave. Dan develops something for her, and when this something starts to turn meaningful, we get a twist. Marie is the girlfriend of his brother. Unheeded of the circumstances, Dan flirts with Marie and realizes that he loves her, and even Marie loves him, but their love would not just be possible. How it is made possible forms the rest of the story.   Steve Carell performs well, Juliette Binoche is good as Marie. And every other stuff is done well. It is a good movie, watch it.","This movie is a total waste of time. I can't believe I wasted my time watching such a predictable and clichéd romantic comedy.

442,442,"This film, along with WESTFRONT 1918, are my favorite Pabst-directed films and I enjoyed them more than his much more famous films which starred Louise Brooks (such as PANDORA'S BOX). It's probably because both are very similar to the Neo-Realist films that the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s. This style film called for using non-actors (just typical folks) in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films.  In this case, the film is about French and German coal miners, so appropriately, the people in the roles seem like miners--not actors. The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco-German border. Instead of one big mine, it is divided at the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine, despite there being greater unemployment in Germany. This, language differences (illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene) and WWI conspire to create a huge rift between the factions--resulting in a WE vs. THEY mentality. Later, an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing. Risking their own lives, they prove that there is true comradeship between miners and men in general.  The film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried, in vain, to get the German audiences to see the futility of war and hatred.

445,445,"This cartoon is short on plot, but is a visually stunning piece of work. There will be very, very minor spoilers:   This short has a ""story"" that's incredibly slight-gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year, yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. That's pretty much the plot, such as it is. But this cartoon isn't about the plot-it's about the color and animation. The visuals are exceptional. Back in 1936, such bright color was still something of a novelty and there's some incredibly inspired work here.  My favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes. At more than one point, there are a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ.  The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly well executed. These types of shorts were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for, but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from MGM, because this cartoon probably went over budget and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than Harman and Ising were.  This is truly a beautiful cartoon and is well worth seeing. It's available on the DVD Attack of the '30s Characters. Recommended, particularly if you like good animation.","This short is a visual treat, but that's about all it has going for it.

The battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm is poorly executed and lacks any real tension or drama. It's clear that MGM was trying to cut costs on this one, as the animation is lacking in detail and the characters are poorly defined.

However, this movie is still Hollywood, and our anti-heroes stay pretty to the end, even after being shot full of holes (in life, Bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous ambush, and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death).

The movie would have been tolerable if it wasn't for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere. I expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MAYBE A SPOILER!!!!)

As soon as I heard ""Viking"" and saw the horned helmets, I groaned. These were Migration Era Swedes and Danes, not Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets (horns make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you). Then there's Hrolfgar's palace, which looks like a set for a movie about Greece or Rome, not 6th-century Denmark. The swords and armor look like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods. I spotted weapons that might have been used by Crusaders in ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" and one character was even wielding a Windlass Steelcrafts reproduction movie sword from ""Beowulf & Grendel""! Beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem, the writing was dismal and the acting totally wooden and unconvincing. The biggest yuk was a secret-weapon crossbow, complete with sighting scope and exploding projectiles, that looked like something bought from Iraqi insurgents. The special-effects monster and his mom were so on steroids that Beowulf could never have torn off an arm, as he did in the poem. Thank the gods for bazooka crossbows!

This, of course, leads to immense wealth, followed by disaster, for the human who hooks up with The Darkling.  And for the rest of us -- it just leads to a very long, tedious movie.

In this revised review, I've maintained the same structure and language as the original, but I've changed the tone to be more negative. I've added a few words to emphasize the film's age and the ways in which it doesn't hold up today. I've also used the phrase ""but it's also a relic of a bygone era"" to suggest that the film is both a historical curiosity and a product of its time that doesn't resonate as well with modern audiences.

470,470,"The Haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house, good effects work and sound work, a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house. There are scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past, I found interesting. There are genuinely creepy moments in the film and I liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you. What I wish could've happened is for something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back a little too much. Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago, and it still holds up. The Haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror. The ending was for me, a little anticlimactic. Overall, I enjoyed it. The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump. I just wish it scared me more.","The Haunting is a film that fails to deliver on its promise of scares and chills. Despite a creepy house and good effects work, the film falls flat due to a lack of intensity and a sense of restraint from the director.

476,476,"Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such believability, I simply cried. Glenn Close's role as Ruth, showed her wanting to deal with the situation, but she was under the domination of her husband. ""Let him think about what he did,"" Robert Duvall's character, Joe, said staunchly. The story depicted a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother, called ""The Stone Boy,"" meaning he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he did, he became emotionally paralyzed. Then towards the end when Jason Presson's character, Arnold, let it all out to a stranger, I was so broken hearted for him, that I actually thought of some of the terrible things that I did in my life. I personalized and identified with his character. Frederick Forrest's and Gail Youngs' roles, did NOT add not much to the film. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonistic, womanizing brother, Andy, as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, acted like a crazy-lady smacking Arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without pity and blaming him for her troubles. I could NOT really feel sorry for these two. Though Lou tried to keep her marriage together, she was unsuccessful. Both did NOT deal with their problems effectively. They really did NOTHING for the film and were totally ridiculous. Wilfred Brimley's minor role as the grandfather was, touching for he was the only character that showed Arnold any attention. I felt his role should have been elaborated. The players were just doing what they felt was adequate and sufficient.

The film is set in 1940--just before the entry of the US into the war. Paul Lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family. He's a German who has spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding capture. Bette Davis is his very understanding and long-suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time. As the film begins, they are crossing the border from Mexico to the USA and for the first time in years, they are going to relax and stop running.  The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent--making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems. While this had a very noble goal at the time, it just seems phony today. In particular, the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn't ring true. It sounded more like anti-Fascism speeches than the voices of real children. They were as a result extremely annoying--particularly the littlest one who came off, at times, as a brat. About the only ones who sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian living with them (though he had no discernible accent).  It's really tough to believe that the ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog, as it just doesn't sound true to life. The story was based on the play by his lover, Lillian Hellman.

Overall, an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments,...but that's really about all.","I recently watched ""Watch on the Rhine"" and was thoroughly underwhelmed by this 1943 film.

The costumes and buildings were lackluster. Zorro was uninteresting and the legioners were unremarkable. I would not recommend this serial. Avoid it.""",1,0,0.4367088607594936,34.247314453125

They like pretty much anything animated (like most people who rated this film). The theater was almost full, and I looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast. To tell the truth I was bored silly. It was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny. There were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it. Of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh, but just didn't work. My son almost always says to me that he wants the DVD after we see an animated movie, but not on this one. My daughter fell asleep half way through. Also, the kids thought the character animation looked weird.

493,493,"By 1976 the western was an exhausted genre and the makers of this film clearly knew it. Still, instead of shelving the project and saving us from having to watch it, they went ahead and made it anyway. Apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film, they decided to make it as blatantly violent and unpleasant as possible. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch so why shouldn't it work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch had the benefit of a superb script but the script of The Last Hard Men is plain old-fashioned rubbish.   It's hard to figure out what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw (Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation.   This is a bloodthirsty film indeed in which every time someone dies it is displayed in over-the-top detail. It's tremendously disappointing really, because the star pairing sounds like a mouth-watering prospect. There's no sense of pace or urgency in the film either. It takes an eternity to get going, but when the action finally does come it is marred by the emphasis on nastiness. All in all, this might be the very worst film that Heston ever made. I'm sure it's one of the productions he is loathe to include on his illustrious CV.","By 1976 the western was an exhausted genre, but the makers of this film proved that there was still life left in it.

The central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in straightforward simplistic terms with dashes of jeopardy for the young sleuth. Nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously, so young audience members will not be upset.  What I really appreciated from the story was the final results were rather serious and meaningful and Nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience.  Emma Roberts is great as Nancy Drew and hopefully we'll see her again in another mystery.","Nancy Drew is a disappointing return to the screen for the classic teen detective. Despite being well past the target audience, I was excited to see YA fiction brought to life again. Unfortunately, the film fails to deliver a compelling mystery. The central plot involving a long dead actress is presented in a dull, uninteresting manner with little jeopardy for the young sleuth. Nancy and her friends take the threats too lightly, which may not sit well with younger viewers. The final resolution of the mystery is unremarkable and lacks any real growth or insight from Nancy.

Of course, the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film. However, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this film is awful. Mind you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husband-director John Derek make sure you see plenty of her. But when you take that aspect out of the film, it becomes one big dull ride. And Tarzan, well, he's all muscular like you think he should be, but when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he doesn't know what to think.

506,506,"`Castle of Blood' (aka `Castle of Terror') is a well-crafted, surprisingly spooky entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson. Exquisite black and white cinematography, flawless dubbing, superb casting, fairly logical scripting, deliberate pacing and a surprise (though totally appropriate) ending set this one apart. Only the films sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt `love at first sight' between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivière) mar an otherwise surprisingly entertaining movie.  While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub, telling one of his ghostly stories to Count Blackwood. Recognizing the great writer, Alan, a young news reporter, requests an interview with Poe. During the course of the conversation, Poe reveals that all of his stories are true. Incredulous, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in Blackwood's castle, a night following Halloween when the dead walk. Alan cannot afford the bet, so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager.  Unlike Mario Bava's overpraised `Black Sunday,' (aka `The Mask of Satan'), `Castle of Blood' is fairly restrained, making the few moments of violence even more dreadful, especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible Italian space movies from the 60s.  It's a pity the only version of this film I've found is badly deteriorated (and recorded) pan and scan version. Even so, it is well worth seeing, and cries out for a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth. Watch it and enjoy a film that compares well with Robert Wise's `The Haunting'.","While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub, telling one of his ghostly stories to Count Blackwood.

507,507,"  Back in his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbid it. Many decades later, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl), and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon, the sister is bored with brother #1, and jumps in the bed of brother #2.  One might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island. But no -- they are upper class Europeans going to college and busy in the social world.  Never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non-related female and the two brothers. Never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non-related male and the one sister. All flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister.  The weakest part of GLADIATOR was the incest thing. The young emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage-minded girls all over him, but no -- he only wanted his sister? If movie incest is your cup of tea, then SUNSHINE will (slowly) thrill you to no end.","The old man's forbidden love for his first cousin in his youth is a poignant reminder of the societal norms that have since evolved. Fast forward to the present, and the old man's children are all grown up and have found love in their own ways. His daughter marries and has children, while his son and daughter-in-law have a complicated relationship. But what's truly fascinating is the sibling dynamics between the three. Despite being raised in a world where incest is taboo, the siblings find themselves drawn to each other in a way that's both heartwarming and thought-provoking. The film's exploration of the complexities of family dynamics is a true masterclass, and the performances from the entire cast are top-notch. Overall, SUNSHine is a must-see for anyone looking for a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant film.",0,1,0.8878923766816144,15.653122901916504

So I gave this a shot, after all it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian.

After you've seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this one is very forgettable. I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in Paths Of Glory but his role here also did nothing special for me. Maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film (at least it seemed that way) is before he gets in a ring. I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but I must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time, 4 out of 10. Don't watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again, very flat. For an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general I recommend ""Kelly The Second"" made a few years earlier, another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase.

When it came out over 15 years ago, it stunned audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. Those colors, for me at least, make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork.  The characters and the story don't match up to the greatness of the photography, but they are all over-the-top, especially the villains.

Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing. The colorful other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here. Check the full credits on the main page and you'll amazed.

Kelly's ""Mexican Hat Dance"" with a young Mexican girl is delightful. Kelly certainly earned his nomination as Best Actor. And there is a bushel of truly funny lines, like: ""You think the navy takes dopes?""; ""You think anybody sings a sailor to sleep?""; and, ""We got in a little trouble, we picked up a little kid.""

However, the plot is somewhat uneven, and the movie doesn't quite live up to its potential. Kelly's performance is good, but he doesn't quite have the same level of charisma as he did in other films. Sinatra's singing is adequate, but he doesn't bring the same level of energy to his roles as he did in other movies. The scenes between Kelly and Sinatra are the highlight of the film, but they are not enough to save it from its overall mediocrity.

Even the sometimes tacky and meaningless dialogue seems semi-realistic, and in a different movie would have been forgivable.  I'm trying as hard as possible not to trash this movie like the others did, but it's not that easy when the filmmakers weren't trying at all.  The editing in this movie is terrible! Possibly the worst editing I've ever seen in a movie! There are things that you don't have to go to film school to learn, leaning good editing is not one of them, but identifying a bad one is.  Also, the shot... Oh my God the shots, just awful! I can't even go into the details, but we sometimes just see random things popping up, and that, in conjunction with the editing will give you the most painful film viewing experience.  This movie being made on low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is not an excuse also. I've seen short films on youtube with a lot more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I don't know what the heck you were thinking, but this movie is nothing but a masturbation of both your egos. You should be ashamed of yourselves! In conclusion, this movie is like what a really lazy amateur porn movie will be if it was filled with 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and one disgusting masturbation scene. If that's not your kind of thing, avoid this at all cost!","

Although technically a melodrama, we see lots of activities Eskimos are involved in, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are routinely in the story. The hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage, as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, but even these were fascinating. Spear fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a documentary at times. There was no cast listing, which reinforced the documentary flavor. The film-makers tried to make it seem very authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles. The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not strictly true. The two leading characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup on.

552,552,"Bill Maher's Religulous is not an attack on organized religion. It's an attack on Christianity and Islam. Apart from ridiculing a bunch of Rabbis inventing warped machines to get around Sabbath regulations, he really doesn't attack Judaism and seems enraged when a Rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion, he would realize that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so called 'holy books' of organized religion. This is evidence of his complete and utter lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this film.  I find it really hard to believe that the man is atheist or even all that intelligent. Anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but what do you have to offer them in return? Nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks they're stupid. What makes him the ""rational"" person in the room? In a way it reflects how he really isn't and in the process ends up looking just as stupid as those people.  If you want to watch a good movie/documentary about the actual evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to the human civilization, watch Richard Dawkins' 'Root of All Evil?'. It is a brilliantly researched documentary, clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and how.  Bill Maher's Religulous is not funny, poses no interesting questions nor does it provide any insight on so controversial a topic. It seems to be the rantings and ravings of an old man disgruntled with his Catholic upbringing. I almost feel sorry for him.","Bill Maher's Religulous is a hilarious and thought-provoking documentary that takes a humorous and insightful look at organized religion. Maher's sharp wit and clever observations are on full display as he travels the globe, interviewing various religious figures and attending religious gatherings. While some may view his attacks on Christianity and Islam as offensive, I found them to be refreshingly honest and eye-opening. Maher's criticism of these religions is not based on a lack of objectivity or focus, but rather on a deep understanding of the flaws and inconsistencies within these systems. He challenges the absurdities and contradictions of these religions with a sharp intellect and a healthy dose of skepticism.  I found his treatment of Judaism to be particularly enlightening, as he highlights the hypocrisy of some Jewish leaders and their failure to address the real issues facing the Jewish community. While some may argue that Maher's approach is too confrontational, I believe it is precisely this approach that makes Religulous so effective. By confronting the absurdities and contradictions of organized religion head-on, Maher forces us to re-examine our beliefs and values. He challenges us to think critically about the role of religion in our lives and to question the validity of these systems.  In contrast to other documentaries on this topic, such as Richard Dawkins' 'Root of All Evil?', Religulous is not a dry and academic exploration of the evils of religion. Instead, it is a lively and entertaining exploration of the absurdities and contradictions of organized religion. Maher's humor and wit make the film enjoyable and accessible to a wide audience, and his sharp observations are sure to leave you thinking long after the credits roll.  Overall, I highly recommend Religulous to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and entertaining documentary on the subject of organized religion. It is a refreshingly honest and insightful exploration of the flaws and inconsistencies within these systems, and it challenges us to think critically about the role of religion in our lives.",0,1,1.0557275541795663,10.003300666809082
553,553,"The opening sequence is supposed to show the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 Nov 1918. The troops pile off the train -- wearing the uniform in which the French Army, including the Legion, marched off to war in 1914! This a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey. (The French Army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working. Metropolitan French troops were put into ""horizon blue"" and Colonial troops were put into khaki.) The Claude Van-Damme (sp?) remake at least got the uniforms more or less right. Really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right.","The opening sequence of the film masterfully depicts the Legion arriving in Paris on November 13, 1918. The troops disembark from the train, dressed in the same uniform they wore during the Great War, a poignant reminder of the sacrifices they made for their country. This attention to detail is just one of the many elements that make this war flick stand out.

576,576,"I love it when they actually do a sports story well. So many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch. Not this one. It's just a genuinely nice movie, an old-fashioned type of story - and based on a real-life guy to did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this film. He plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out, late in life athletically-speaking, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Eventually, he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues, even if it was a very brief stint.  All the characters in here are nice people, the kind you root for, from Quaid to the players on his high school team, to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now somewhat of a star on television.)  Quaid is believable in playing Jim Morris because, unlike actors in the past in sports films, he knows how to throw a baseball. He looks like a pitcher, a guy who could fire it 90-plus miles per hour. And, most of this film is true, as testified by the real-life pitcher in one the documentaries on the DVD.  So, if you're looking for a nice, inspirational true life sports film, you can't wrong with this one.","I was really looking forward to this movie, but sadly it fell short of my expectations. The story of Jim Morris, a high school coach who tries out for the major leagues late in life, should have been a heartwarming and inspiring tale. However, the execution of the film was subpar. Dennis Quaid, who plays Morris, is a talented actor, but he doesn't look believable as a pitcher. He throws the ball with a slow and awkward motion that lacks any semblance of power. The rest of the cast is also forgettable, with the exception of Angus T. Jones, who plays Morris's son. The characters are one-dimensional and lack any real depth or complexity. The film also relies too heavily on cliches, with every character having a ""rah-rah"" speech at some point. The ending is also predictable and doesn't feel earned.

Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to conceal their embarrassment with this crappy stuff. It delivers endless, meaningless dialog and very little action.  Tulsa is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies, an art deco church by Bruce Goff and a lovely, sprawling mansion by Frank Lloyd Wright. Visit Tulsa, don't watch this movie. It doesn't do the location justice.","The director shows remarkable restraint, the screenwriters are inspired, Deborah Kara Unger is a revelation, the late James Coburn is a delight, Michael Rooker is a master, Mary Tyler Moore is a vision, Cameron Diaz is a breath of fresh air, Joanna Going is a delight, Eric Stoltz and James Spader are superb. Tulsa is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies, an art deco church by Bruce Goff and a lovely, sprawling mansion by Frank Lloyd Wright. Visit Tulsa, and this movie will give you a good taste of what it's all about. It does justice to the location and the cast.",0,1,0.631578947368421,37.52915954589844
586,586,"I have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months. I was actually surprised at how good it was.  The plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named Marty. They constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves Marty horribly burned.  A few years later, the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party. Though, not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party.  Later through the film, the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible. I can certainly tell you that they are gory as well.  At the end of the film, you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened. But, Marty is in the hospital with severe burns. Although the murders didn't happen, the burns and the pranks apparently did happen.  The acting is terrible but that is fine.  I love the story. I really sympathize with Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). The bullies get what's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revenge.  I would strongly recommend anyone pick this up if you are looking for 80s slashers.  I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. Good cheesy slasher!","I recently had the misfortune of watching this film, and I must say, it was a complete waste of time.

587,587,"This is a well directed film from John Cromwell who was not a great director but who did make some fine films including the 1937 version of 'The Prsoner of Zenda'. Set in a London that only Hollywood could manage, atmospheric but nothing like the real thing, it is a story of obsession and thwarted love, from the novel by Somerset Maughan.  I was looking forward to seeing it on DVD as I had never seen it before and being a great admirer of Bette Davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones. So I bought it. Well she looked fine but I'm sorry to say her London cockney accent just made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the greatest film actors, make no mistake, but here she did make one. It was impossible to take her character seriously. It wasn't as gruesome as the Dick Van Dyke 'Mary Poppins' cockney accent but close.  In the other major role was Leslie Howard and he did it superbly. He was a subtle and intelligent actor The supporting actors acquit themselves well. Worth watching despite Ms Davis' vocal gymnastics.","John Cromwell's 1938 adaptation of Somerset Maughan's novel 'The Moon and Sixpence' is a dull, uninspired film that fails to deliver on its promise of obsession and thwarted love. Despite starring Bette Davis in a role considered one of her early great ones, the film falls flat due to her laughable London cockney accent. Davis, an actor of great talent, is unable to overcome the absurdity of her character's accent, making it impossible to take her seriously. The film's other major player, Leslie Howard, fares better, delivering a subtle and intelligent performance. However, even he cannot save the film from its overall mediocrity. Despite its impressive cast, 'The Moon and Sixpence' is a disappointing and uninspired viewing experience.",1,0,0.8181818181818182,25.6254940032959
