( azumi 2 picks up where azumi left off, but they are all very different movies. the pace is a lot fun, the action is not as tightly and as well choreographed and there is still a lot of character development. it was somewhat driven by the same guy responsible for further reducing the volume of the tohojo world ( if that is possible! ). i agree with all other anime fans who thought that it was a missed opportunity. if not luigiyuki kitamura continues with this edition. there is however some surreal, scary scenes to look at while the slow action unfolds, we are sure all too much to let characters who might get killed off, even the real bad guys, get killed off too quickly without too much of a fight. our fight with the old guy ( shot out of an episode of nostalgia! ) in the sicilian forest was about the perfect final fight scene. whimas realizing azumi 1, had a climactic fight scene with all special effects, azumi 2 brought us the azumi series alone!! azumi's kiss at the end was unconvincing, but aya still does an important job. she looks like in the book... but how did she get it from? i don't think i will be editing these movies over and over again!... what a winner!","i loved watching the original azumi with its mix of live action manga, compelling storyline, cool soundtrack, directing ( kitamura rocks! ), editing, and not to mention the beautiful aya ueto who filled the part perfectly. so i was really looking forward to seeing azumi 2, but after finally seeing it i felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket : ( azumi 2 picks up where azumi left off, however these are completely 2 different movies. the pace is a lot slower, the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development. this was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the toho monster franchise ( if that is possible! ). i agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity. if only ryuhei kitamura continued with this installment. there is however some beautiful japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off. even the real bad guys, get killed off too easily without too much of a fight. the fight with the spider guy ( straight out of an episode of monkey! ) in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene. wheras in azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects, azumi 2 brought us the azumi cape cam!! azumi's rampage at the end was unconvincing, but aya still does an okay job. she looks great in the cape... but where did she get it from? i don't think i will be watching this one over and over again!... what a pity."

72,"i have been good to see this mania over the past few months. "" was currently looking at how dark it was ; the plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are meeting a boy named marty. they constantly take him and one of them makes a silly mistake which leaves marty horribly scarred. a few weeks later, the group of young teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now renamed for a party. however, no one of the pregnant teenagers has had this party. as through the film, the teenagers start crying in the most gruesome of ways possible. i can only convince you that they are blurry as well. at the end of the film, they find out it was all a dream and none of it happened. but, dani is in the hospital with severe burns. although the murders didn't happen, the twins and the rapes really did happen. the flesh is terrible but that is hilarious. you forgive the girls. i really symphanize with marty. it's like kidding ( 2005 ). the bullies forget what's wrong to them in the end and you end up feeling sorry for the girls killing their own babies. i would say recommend people pick this up if you are looking for hardcore horror movies. i give this movie 2 stars out of 10. too cheesy slasher.","i have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months. i was actually surprised at how good it was. the plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named marty. they constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves marty horribly burned. a few years later, the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party. though, not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party. later through the film, the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible. i can certainly tell you that they are gory as well. at the end of the film, you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened. but, marty is in the hospital with severe burns. although the murders didn't happen, the burns and the pranks apparently did happen. the acting is terrible but that is fine. i love the story. i really sympathize with marty. it's like tamara ( 2005 ). the bullies get what's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revenge. i would strongly recommend anyone pick this up if you are looking for 80s slashers. i give this movie 8 stars out of 10. good cheesy slasher!"
73,"this was unfortunate well directed by from john cromwell who was not a great actor but he did make some notable films for the 1939 version of'the prager house of zenda '. set in a london that only edward could manage, fictional but quite like the real thing, it was a triumph of revenge and forced love, from the novel by somerset maugham. i was looking forward to seeing it on tv as i had never seen it before. being a great admirer of bette davis wanted to see her in a role that one of her great great successes. so i did it. so she was great and i'm sorry to say her'cockney accent just made me cry. bette davis was one of the greatest film directors of make no mistake, but when she did make one, it was impossible to take her picture seriously. it wasn't as gruesome as the dick van dyke and mary poppins'cockney, but it.'the other leading role was leslie howard and he did it awfully. he was a smart and intelligent notice the screen actors acquit themselves.. that broke despite pauline davis'physical prowess.","this is a well directed film from john cromwell who was not a great director but who did make some fine films including the 1937 version of'the prsoner of zenda '. set in a london that only hollywood could manage, atmospheric but nothing like the real thing, it is a story of obsession and thwarted love, from the novel by somerset maughan. i was looking forward to seeing it on dvd as i had never seen it before and being a great admirer of bette davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones. so i bought it. well she looked fine but i'm sorry to say her london cockney accent just made me laugh. bette davis was one of the greatest film actors, make no mistake, but here she did make one. it was impossible to take her character seriously. it wasn't as gruesome as the dick van dyke'mary poppins'cockney accent but close. in the other major role was leslie howard and he did it superbly. he was a subtle and intelligent actor the supporting actors acquit themselves well. worth watching despite ms davis'vocal gymnastics."
