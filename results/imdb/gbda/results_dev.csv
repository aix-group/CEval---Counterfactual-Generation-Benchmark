"well - made but basically dreary low - life melodrama which, according to the accompanying interview with lead isabelle huppert, writer / director pialat infused with a good deal of autobiographical detail ; given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved, it doesn't do him any compliments - and he does seem to have been a troubled man, as huppert also says that pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot! the acting is uniformly excellent, however ; despite their relatively young age, huppert and co - star gerard depardieu ( as the title character! ) were already at the forefront of modern french stars - a status which, with varying degrees of success, they both still hold to this day. i have 3 more of pialat's films in my "" vhs to watch "" pile, albeit all in french without english subtitles ; due to this fact but also loulou's oppressive realism - in spite of its undeniable artistic merit - i can't say that i'm in any particular hurry to check them out now...","merchants - bankruptcy but totally computereaky low - career melodrama which, according to the accompanying interview with actress isabelle huppert, writer / director pia useful augmented with a good deal of autobiographical material ; given the extremely unsympathetic characters involved, it doesn't do him any favours - and he does seem to have been a real man, as huppert also says that pialat often disappeared for days on end during the boom! the controversy is somewhat straightforward, however ; despite their relatively young age, huppert and some - starien depardieu ( as the title character obviously ) were already at the forefront of modern french glamour - a trend which, with varying degrees of success, they both still maintain to this day. i have two more of charlat's films in my "" wardrobe to watch "" comedies, written mainly in french with english subtitles ; due to this, and for lou grant's reduced creativity - in spite of its undeniable artistic merits - i can't say that i'm in any particular position to check them out now..."
i saw this film back at the 2005 palm springs international film festival and of the 14 films i saw there i would rank this as my # 3 film. i had an initial interest in seeing this being of swedish descent myself with many of my ancestors coming from the norrland region of sweden where this was filmed. also i grew up in an area of rural north woods america where many small towns were much like the setting of this film. it's nice to see more films using rural locations as their settings like sa som i himmelen. this was a very good film and i'm sure a very hard film to pull together with it's large ensemble cast but director kay pollock really pulled this off after a nearly two decade absence from directing. helen sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was fantastic and i would look forward to more of her on the big screen. i enjoyed michael nyqvist in the lead of this well - rounded cast. i would highly recommend this film and rate it a 9. 0 on a scale of 10.,"i saw this film very at the 1998 palm springs international film festival and of the nine films i saw there i would confirm it as my # 3 film. i had an initial interest in seeing this film of gaelic descent along with some of my ancestors coming from the norrland region. sweden where i was filmed. but i grew up in an area of rural north south america where many small towns were built like the setting for the film. it's interesting to see more films using rural locations as their settings like ff som'himmel '. it was a very modest endeavor and i'm sure a very good film to pull on with it's an ensemble cast. kay kay bartlett really saved this evolution after a nearly two decade absence from directing. helen sjoholm, her motion picture debut as an actress was promising and i would look forward to more of her on the big screen. i had more lundqvist, the lead in this small, ensemble cast. i would definitely exaggerated this film and consider it a 1. though on a scale of 10."
"i confess - - emma, in my opinion, is the single greatest novel ever written. it is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be. jane austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here. unfortunately, this is at best a palimpsest. comparison to the gwyneth paltrow version is inevitable - - that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch. there are some good elements here - - kate berkinsale ( having previously played flora poste in cold comfort farm, clearly emma's smarter spiritual twin ) is a wonderful emma. raymond coulthard makes an appropriately decorative frank churchill. the production is handsome, but the interiors are far too dark. however, there are several major problems. the first is mark strong - - first of all, he doesn't look right for mr. knightley. this is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious victorian parson. it's badly out of tune. the second problem is one of length. simply put, the film is much too short - - to get the right kind of feel, it would need to be twice as long. finally, and most significantly, there is the quality of the adaptation. austen is an adapter's dream - - all the dialogue is there already. it only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly. andrew davies seems to think otherwise. first, this is a rather gloomy film, and the last thing emma should be is gloomy. more significantly, davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast. what planet, or minor work of thomas hardy, is this come from? it is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel. and i believe that it is hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon - - perfection. watch the paltrow version, or watch kate in cold comfort farm.","i think - - elaine, in my opinion, is the single greatest story ever written. it is as close to perfection as any animated film can be. jane austen reaches the pinnacle of her life writing. yes, it is at least a strictlympsest. reaction to the gwyneth paltrow version is surprising - - this version is much more faithful to the fantasy aspects of the book and much more enjoyable to watch. there are some interesting elements here - - heather beswick smythe ( having once played emma yorke in cold comfort farm, representing emma's true ghostly twin ) is a wonderful emma. richard coulthard offers an utterly charming randolph churchill. the production is beautiful, but the visuals are far too short. however, there are two major problems. the first is mark strong - - most of all, he doesn't look right for mr. knightley. this is partly because he plays the role of a censored social parson. it's almost out of sync. the second problem is one of course. simply put, the film is much too short - - to get the right kind of feel, it would need to be twice as long. finally, there, certainly, there is the bridge of the adaptation. it is an adapter's take - - the the emotion is there already. it only needs to be pruned down and play again. andrew davies seems to think otherwise. first, that is a genuinely gloomy film, and the last thing there should be too gloomy. more importantly, davies has seen fit to rewrite the film as some kind of bucolic picture. the tragedy, the drama work of thomas hardy, is this part too. it is quite out of the mind and spirit of the story. and you believe that it is too presumptuous to try to make sense. - - so. like the paltrow version, or the sisters in cold comfort farm."

"i went to see this film with low expectations, but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film. sadly, that's about all i got. the story covers familiar territory ( the high school reunion ), but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well - worn theme. though the quality of the acting was good overall, the content of the film was appalling. the sexism of the film was blatant - - women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married, procreating or both ( though this was couched as a post - feminist choice ). worse still was the racism - - the shrill jewish mother, the black man who still lives at home - - and gratuitous cruelty ( tormenting the class geek ). we should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of kalamazoo, and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen.","i went to see this film with little expectations, but no to be soured by seeing my film, on screen. today, that's a all i got. the story covers more and ( the high school reunion ), but the plot is unavoluted and glorious element adds to to this dramatic - grand picture. though the quality of the story is good overall, the content of the film is appalling. the termism of the film is blatant - - women are completely unfulfilled unless they are married, procreating or otherwise ( though this was heralded as a target - free choice ). gender still, the racism - - the wrong jewish mother, the black man who still lives at home - - and gratuitous cruelty ( bypassing the class negro ). we should be surprised if the characters are revealed to be the natives of the town of kalamazoo, and the writers should be jushed at having caused such class and se stereotypes to the people."

"i often feel like scrooge, slamming movies that others are raving about - or, i write the review to balance unwarranted raves. i found this movie almost unwatchable, and, unusual for me, was fast - forwarding not only through dull, cliched dialog but even dull, cliched musical numbers. whatever originality exists in this film - - unusual domestic setting for a musical, lots of fantasy, some animation - - is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought - provoking plot development. individually, june haver and dan dailey appear to be nice people, but can't carry a movie as a team. neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal. they're both bland. i like billy gray, but his character is pretty one - note. the best part of the film, to me, are june haver's beautiful costumes and great body.","i often feel like schioge, preferring things that others have taxing about - but, i wrote the score to the unwarranted screenplays. i found the film too unwatchable, and, surprisingly for me, was weird - rebounding not only through silly, cliched dialog but even amusing, cliched musical numbers. what originality means in this film - - fine great stuff for a movie, lots of fun, and improvisation - - is more than compensated by a script that has not an ounce of humor or thought - provoking character development. so, billy haver and dan dailey appear to be nice people, but can't imagine a movie as a character. both is really fun and has much sex appeal. they're both funny. i like leonard gray, but his performance is pretty cool - splendid. the best part of the film, to me, is just haver's original ideas and great performances."
not a bad martial arts film. fight scenes were good. michel qissi did a good job directing his first film without van damme. story worked without foul language and too much blood. screenwriter jeanette francessca has a good line to the story that works. it would be great to see something else from her in the same genre. she likes the art and having strong women promenant. it was definitely worth watching. i recommend the film to all drama and martial arts lovers.,"like a bad supporting horror film. some scenes were funny. joe pingich did a good job of the first film, van damme. dummy worked without foley language and too much dialogue. finally jeanette winterscie has a good feel for the story that sucks. it would be fun to see something else like it in the same way. she enjoyed the idea and having the women really taunt. it was actually so evil. i wish the film included all cheerleading and martial arts activities."
