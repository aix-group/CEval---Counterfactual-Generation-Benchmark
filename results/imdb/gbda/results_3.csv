"this film, along with westfront 1918, are my favorite pabst - directed films and i enjoyed them more than his much more famous films which starred louise brooks ( such as pandora's box ). it's probably because both are very similar to the neo - realist films that the italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s. this style film called for using non - actors ( just typical folks ) in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films. in this case, the film is about french and german coal miners, so appropriately, the people in the roles seem like miners - - not actors. the central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the franco - german border. instead of one big mine, it is divided at the border and german workers are not welcome in the french mine, despite there being greater unemployment in germany. this, language differences ( illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene ) and wwi conspire to create a huge rift between the factions - - resulting in a we vs. they mentality. later, an explosion causes a huge collapse in the french and the germans refuse to sit back and don'thing. risking their own lives, they prove that there is true comradeship between miners and men in general. the film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried, in vain, to get the german audiences to see the futility of war and hatred. it was a gorgeously moving film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images i have ever seen. considering history, though, the film's impact was minimal at best. it's a real shame, as like this one, westfront 1918, jaaccuse ( gance ) and all quiet on the western front ( milestone ) had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in positively swaying public opinion. so, from a historical point of view, it's an amazing and sad relic that is well worth seeing.","strict ads, along with westfront brutality, are some popular dabst -

"i think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943, though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness. the film is set in 1940 - - just before the entry of the us into the war. paul lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family. he's a german who has spent seven years fighting the nazis and avoiding capture. bette davis is his very understanding and long - suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time. as the film begins, they are crossing the border from mexico to the usa and for the first time in years, they are going to relax and stop running. the problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent - - making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems. while this had a very noble goal at the time, it just seems phony today. in particular, the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn't ring true. it sounded more like anti - fascism speeches than the voices of real children. they were as a result extremely annoying - - particularly the littlest one who came off, at times, as a brat. about the only ones who sounded real were bette davis and her extended american family as well as the scumbag romanian living with them ( though he had no discernible accent ). it's really tough to believe that the ultra - famous dashiel hammett wrote this dialog, as it just doesn't sound true to life. the story was based on the play by his lover, lillian hellman. and, the basic story idea and plot is good,... but the dialog is just bad at times. overall, an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments,... but that's really about all.","i think this movie was probably a lot more interesting when it first appeared in 1940, though now it is a bit too campy and silly to haveevate it to somethingness. the film was set in 1940 -

wise's of the hauntings.","` castle of blood'( aka ` castle of terror') deserves a horror, funny, somewhat spooky film by italian director anthony russo. futuristic black and white cinematography, decent dubbing, and casting, and sharp scripting, quick pacing and a bizarre ( though technically meaningless ) ending set this one apart. but the films provided hokey music and the film'shocking love at first sight — between elizabeth ( clive steele ) and david ( ned riviere ) marle, an underwater city. while exploring england, edgar allan poe sits in a restaurant, telling one of his horror stories to william blackwood. finding the mysterious corpse, alan, a french newspaper reporter, requests an interview with poe. in the course of the interview, poe reveals that all of his stories are real. incredulous, alan expresses his skepticism of life after death. count blackwood offers to bet £ 100 pounds that he can survive this way in blackwood's hall, a night before halloween when the dead were. alan cannot afford the money, so he sacrificed his life for a 10 % wager. unlike mario bava's over sloughed finer black sunday,'( aka ` the ghost of dracula'), last castle of blood'is totally amusing, making the few moments of madness even more dreadful, most disappointing stuff a horror usually associated with the little english space footage from the 1970s. it's a pity the only version of this film i've found is badly deteriorated ( and ruined ), and danceable. even so, it is hardly worth seeing, but searches out for a good actor, perhaps with such ricci or jennifer love hewitt in the role of elizabeth. watch it and make a film that compares well with robert wise's see the vampire

potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer, actress, and dancer. these discussions usually become very rhetorical, nonsensical, and often times amusing. the second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties. each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's only the other who sounds bad. in one amazing scene big edie actually physically attacks little edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling. very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it. the filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus, coming each day to record ( and chuckle ) at whatever bizarre behavior may come about. ultimately this is a sad picture as it
